Video of Matt explaining On Time (2 min)
It is critical to be on time for every appointment you have made or let the others involved in the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize it. This action is common decency, yes, but it has greater significance. 
There is a person on the other side of your agreement to start the meeting at a specific time. They have stopped what they are working on to attend the meeting on time. If you do not show up on time, they cannot start the meeting, but they also cannot leave because they don't know if you'll show up the next minute or not. 
Each minute they are away from their work is a minute of productivity you have stolen from them. This action is not only disrespectful but also counterproductive. If the attendee is a customer, investor, or recruit, they will not engage with your company. If they report to you, they will keep quiet but resent you. There is no winning scenario when you waste someone's time.
But life happens. Calls and meetings run late, or traffic doesn't cooperate. Even with careful planning, it's not possible to be on time for every meeting. The good news is that you don't need to be. 
It is only critical to let the other members of the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize that you will be. And you must come to this realization (and let the other attendees know) before the meeting starts, through whatever channel will get to them the fastest. Ideally, you'd let them know about the delay before they must break away from whatever they are doing before the meeting.
In addition to being on time, you must also be present. Being present means that you are composed, prepared, and focused on the subject matter. It can take a few minutes to ""get present"" -- prepare the agenda, research the topic and the attendees, etc. 
 Therefore, I recommend that you plan to arrive at an outside meeting fifteen minutes before it is to begin. For a meeting in your office, wrap up your current project five minutes before the scheduled meeting time. 
To make this easy, I recommend scheduling 25 and 50-minute meetings only (Google Calendar even has an automated setting for this). This buffer will give you five minutes each half-hour and ten minutes each hour to gather yourself.
When in the meeting, I often see CEOs making the mistake of constantly checking their messages. They cannot get away from being ""on,"" if even for a second. This habit is disrespectful, but it also defeats the purpose of the meeting, which is a collaboration with the attendees present. It sends a message that the meeting's content is relatively unimportant. Furthermore, it also breeds a bad habit for the entire company—one that will be hard, if not impossible, to break down the line. 
During every meeting, leave your phone in your pocket or face-down. Staying committed to Inbox Zero will help you focus on your meetings and make the most out of your assembled—and valuable—talent. 
And if the meeting is not efficient, then make it so.

Video of Matt talking about Top Goal (2 min)
In startups, fires never cease to burn. One of the most common complaints I hear from CEOs is that they seem to have infinite things to do on a day-to-day basis, yet weeks will go by, and they don't feel like they have accomplished anything. This dilemma results from getting bogged down with the small immediate things and losing track of the important long-term ones.
The Top Goal framework will help you fix this. Greg McKeown, who wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called Essentialism, boils this down to one key concept: Schedule two hours each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do this every single workday. Period.
The earlier in the day you schedule this Top Goal time, the better to avoid other issues (and people) from pressing for your attention. There is also strong, research-backed evidence to show that we have more decision and thought-processing energy early in the day when our brain is fresh and well-rested. Take advantage of this time when your brain performs at its best by doing the essential things first.
During this Top Goal time, do not respond to emails, texts, calls, and messages. Only work on your top priority during these two hours. If you follow this pattern each workday, you will achieve amazing things.
If you have never scheduled this kind of focused work time, starting with two hours a day will likely be too great of a leap. Instead, start by scheduling 30 minutes for tomorrow early in the day. If that goes well, then plan 30 minutes each weekday morning for a week. If that goes well, increase the daily scheduled time to one hour. Continue growing each week until you find the right balance, knowing that the recommended target is two hours.

Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit ,"Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)


Video of Matt talking about how fear and anger give bad advice (3 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about a time fear and anger gave him bad advice (5 min)
The essence of my coaching is to prove to you that when you feel fear or anger, your brain gives you bad advice. Whenever you notice that you are experiencing fear/anger, therefore, my recommendation is that you do one of the following: 
""Shift"" out of fear/anger before deciding what to do. And in the meantime, take no action. 

OR


If there is urgency and you must act immediately (which is almost never the case), do exactly the opposite of what your brain is recommending. 
If you are in Anger, and your brain is telling you to crush this person who has wronged you, instead get curious about why they did what they did. 


This action does not mean that you don't subsequently end your relationship with this person. It just means that you first genuinely seek to understand why they did what they did. There are lessons there for you because you likely had a hand in creating the situation.


If you are in Fear, and you want to not do an action for fear of the perceived consequences (i.e., give someone blunt feedback), instead do the action (provide them with feedback ... in a kind way). 


Once again, it doesn't mean that there is no risk to the decision. It's just likely that the benefit outweighs the risk. And that the unwanted outcome is likely not as dire as you imagine it to be.
Now, of course, you will be saying, ""Why? What proof do you have that my brain gives me bad advice when I am in anger or fear?"" The write-up below is my attempt to give you that evidence. But the best way is to try the suggestions above one time and see how things turn out. My prediction is that they will turn out well, and then you will not even need to read the rest of this write-up.
But in case you still want to read more ...
The pre-frontal cortex (located in the frontal lobe) is the part of our brain that is generally credited for problem-solving and creative thought. The amygdala (situated near the basal stem and often referred to as ""the reptile brain"") is that part of our brain which generates the emotion of fear or Anger (when presented with new, risky, or threatening stimuli).
In his book The Righteous Mind, John Haidt argues convincingly that human thought starts with an emotion. We react to external stimuli with an emotion (joy, sadness, fear, etc.). Then our powerful brain comes up with a story or perceived-fact pattern that explains our feelings. Once we create this story, confirmation bias causes us to see facts that further support our story, only hardening our belief in its ""truth.""
Emotions are valuable and intelligent signals for us. Fear signals that there is something new here or something potentially risky. It is helpful for us to be aware of that so that we don't proceed recklessly ahead. Similarly, anger signals that there is something that is potentially harming us or those around us. It is valuable for us to be aware of this so that we don't allow it to continue unabated. 
But that is where the intelligence of fear and anger ends. Our rational brain will create a story that justifies fear or anger. This story is usually a prediction that some horrible things will happen if we do an action (or don't do an action). The evolutionary value of fear is that it kept humans alive in a world where risk (the presence of a wild animal) or newness (an unknown berry) often led to death. By preventing humans from proceeding in those situations, fear kept humans alive. So whatever story the mind created to justify the fear contributed to keeping humans alive. A similar pattern existed for anger. 
That was then. In the modern world, the stories that fear creates do prevent us from acting. They do preserve our ego. But they also have a tremendous opportunity cost. By not acting, we never know if the board member that we do not have trust with would step down if we asked them, or whether the person in a critical role who is not performing well (but whom we think we cannot afford to have quit) would start performing if we gave them kind-hearted direct feedback.
When we encounter the unknown, fear predicts that something terrible will happen if we move forward. (Anger predicts that bad things will continue to happen unless we move forward.) But, by definition, we cannot be sure of what will happen in the future. There is a chance that something good will result from the action. If we think about that possibility for several minutes and allow ourselves to breathe deeply, fear often turns into excitement. 
And if we do move forward, we often discover that either our negative predictions don't materialize. Or, if they do, the result is still better than the current state. And when that happens, hopefully, we also have the thought: ""Fear (or anger) was giving me bad advice. I'm glad I didn't follow it.""
For a more thorough explanation of the above, please read Behave, or listen to the author's explanation in this video (1h13m).

If you are convinced that the above is true, you may be thinking: ""Yeah, but how do I catch myself? When I'm in fear or anger, I don't realize it at the moment. I act. It's only much later that I realize it.""
This awareness is a big challenge. You can spend years meditating, and it will provide marginal benefit in your ability to notice when you are in fear or anger. Or you can outsource this function to those around you. 
I far prefer the latter. I have asked everyone I live with (my wife and children) and work with to signal me when they perceive me to be in fear or anger. The words that seem to be the most effective with me are ""I perceive you to be in anger."" When I hear that, I can immediately stop. (By contrast, if they say ""You're in anger"" or ""Are you in anger?"", I feel more anger.)

If you are unconvinced that the writings above are accurate, there is a way to test them. Make a bet with someone. The next time someone perceives you to be in fear (this particular test works better with fear than anger), make a bet with them. Your brain will be making a prediction: ""If I do X, then Y will happen."" Their brain will be making a different prediction, Z, which is likely the opposite of Y. Then, do the action and see what happens. I posit that the other person will win the bet. 
I have made these bets hundreds of times with people that I perceive to be in fear. I have yet to lose. 

(This next idea comes from Regina Gerbeaux, COO at Mochary Method)
Fear Journaling

Or, if there is no one that you feel comfortable making a bet with, then make a bet with yourself.  To do this, create a Fear Journal.  Whenever you feel fear, or someone tells you that they perceive you to be in fear, write down what prediction your brain is making.  Do this regularly so that you are able to make many predictions.  Then, a week or a month or a year later, go back and read the predictions that you made.  See how many of them actually came true.  And if any came true, ask yourself if that outcome was actually negative. 
My posit is that very few, if any, of them will come true.  And those that do will actually turn out to be net positive.

Now you know the danger of acting on the thoughts generated by fear or anger.  Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)
Anger
Now you have a system for knowing when you are in Anger.
Hint: You ask those who are close to you (your colleagues, spouse, kids) to tell you when they perceive you to be in fear or Anger by saying, ""I perceive you to be in fear/anger.""
But how do you then shift out of Anger?
Time will often do the trick. But most of us can't afford a long time before needing our brains to function well, especially when we don't know how long it will take.
There are ways to speed the process up. Here is a very non-exhaustive list of ideas to shift out of Anger. None of these are magic pills. Each is something to experiment with. Find what works for you.
The key is to activate other parts of your brain besides your amygdala. You can do this by getting your brain to focus on something different than the singular perspective you have on this issue. Try ...
A new physical location
If you're sitting down, stand up.
If you're inside, go outside.
A new physical state
If you're still, go outside and start sprinting as fast as you can for 2 minutes.
A new mental state
If you are bombarded by continuous stimulation (as almost all of us are with constant messaging, alerts, screen time, meetings, calls, etc.), then go stimulation-free (turn off all messaging, alerts, screens, etc.). Get bored. Restoration and Creativity: how to achieve them (3 min)
A new perspective on the issue
Do The Work by Byron Katie
Give your feelings and thoughts full expression:
If you feel Anger, go into another room (or a car), grab a pillow and yell as loud as you can into that pillow for 30 seconds. 
Hopefully, the distance and the pillow will muffle the sound enough that no one else will hear you. Practice this first to make sure it's the case.
Keep a journal, and write your worst thoughts full of all the swear words in your head.
There are many other ways. These are just some things with which you can experiment. You only need one that works for you.  
Fear

Fear is less physical than anger, and therefore the shift moves are less physical and more mental.  The Work by Byron Katie works well here.  But for me, the most effective is to make actual predictions.  “If I do this, then x will happen.  And then what?  And then y will happen.  And then what?  And then z will happen ….”  I do this all the way to the end.  

I then either:


Write it down in a Fear Journal (see under “Fear Journaling”: Fear and Anger give bad advice)


I revisit later to see if the predictions came true or not.  They almost never do, certainly not in the net-negative way that I predicted.  Or …


Share my predictions with an accountability partner and ask them what predictions they make.  If we make differing predictions, we make a bet.  


If I am the person feeling fear, I almost always lose the bet.  Of course to see the results of the bet, I need to do the thing that I fear doing.  That requires a push.  But each time I go through this cycle, I need less and less of a push.

Once I lose such a bet or prediction, my mind starts to unwind its belief in the quality of advice that fear gives me.   This is a never-ending process, however, since fear will continue to try to re-assert itself.

Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit ,"Heard:  how to make people feel it (3 min)

Video of Matt explaining Heard:  how to make people feel it (4 min)

When people have a feeling or thought, they want to feel heard. If they don't, they will feel resentment. 
So, how do you make people feel heard? By listening deeply and then actively acknowledging what they say (or even better, what their actual thoughts are).
First, get ready to feel triggered (i.e., anger, fear, sadness). Tell yourself that if these emotions come, they are going to give you bad advice. Instead, imagine a glass case around the person that you are talking to. Anything they say is not going to leave that glass case. None of it hits you.  (This is a critical step, because if you do get triggered, you will not be able to make the person feel heard.  In fact, you will do the opposite.)
Second, ask the person to express what their feelings and thoughts are. Really be present with the person you’re listening to. Put away any distractions. Make it your entire intention to listen fully to understand, not to talk/respond right away.
Third, acknowledge what they said by …
If they are trying to give you feedback (or are simply getting angry at you), then ...
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 

Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  
You can keep going deeper and deeper by repeating this process until the person says “No, that’s it.”  If you allow the person to go all the way down to the core issue, they usually have an ah-ha moment that almost resolves the issue on its own.
If you want to go to the advanced level when repeating back, also describe to them the feeling they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the emotions yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they fear you will get angry if they say what they really think (and then become vindictive). So they have toned down their thought when saying it. If you tone it down, even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will be safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""


What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
Again, say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  (There is almost always more!)
After the above process is complete, to confirm that you have done it correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""

        2. If they are sharing a painful thing that is going on in their life ...
Don't repeat back what they said. Instead, say, ""I imagine that you are feeling …."" And then honestly try to imagine what they are feeling and thinking. Express that. 
""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you can even go deeper by asking …
 ""Is there more?""  Or even better …
“There’s more.  Please tell me more.”  Because there is almost always more! 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Please tell me more.""

What if someone won't say what they are feeling or thinking? No worries, you can still make them feel heard. You have to imagine what they are thinking and say that. ""I imagine that you are thinking something like …."" And then, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done.
If they say, ""No,"" ask them what their thoughts are. Now that they have seen that you won't get angry, they are more likely to share. 
If they still don't share, you can try to imagine their thoughts again. Repeat until they do share and you have reflected it correctly.

This is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is more impactful than acting on their feedback, or helping them solve their problem.

Conversely, if you feel that someone you are talking to is not hearing you, you can simply ask them:  “To make sure that I am communicating well, can you please repeat back what you heard me say.”   If that feels too blunt, you can first share with them this document.

The CEO role is typically thought of as ...
Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company


Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).


Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: investors, customers, partners, employees.


Report to the board and investors


Hire and manage the exec team 


Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.


Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.


Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.


Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.


Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).


Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).


Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.
These are indeed CEO responsibilities. But it doesn't mean that they all need to get done by the CEO. The CEO must ensure that they all get done by someone. And hopefully by someone passionate about that function. Because I posit that only someone who loves a function can be truly good at it, that includes you. If you are not passionate about any of these functions, you will not be good at them.
Most CEOs I coach are product visionaries. They both love and are excellent at:
Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company


Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).

There are three functions that, unfortunately, cannot be outsourced:
Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: employees, partners, customers, and investors.


Report to the board and investors


Hire the exec team
Someone else, however, can do the remainder:
Manage the exec team
 
Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.


Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.


Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.


Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).


Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.


Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).


Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.

In my view, the CEO should only do those functions of the role that she loves to do. The rest she should outsource to someone else who does love them. An easy catch-all is to onboard a COO/President or Chief of Staff (2 min). After 90 days, they will likely be able to do any of the roles that you do not love.


When to fire me as CEO?
If you are completely burned out, or the things that you don't love about the CEO role include people management, hiring, sales, and fundraising (the only thing you love is Product), then its likely time to fire yourself and hire a CEO rather than a CoS or COO. 
Why? Because large customers, investors, and senior executives on your team want to have a direct and ongoing relationship with the person whose title is CEO (i.e., the perceived decision-maker). If you don't want to have those relationships, you have to give the title to the person who will. 
And then name yourself Chairman. Go off and build your ideal life. The joke is that you still get to own all of your equity, that equity will become even more valuable, and you get to build yourself an ideal life.

Video (older) of Matt describing the Exec Ops role (5 min) 
If you find that you are simply not completing the goals you set for yourself each week, or you do so, but some or many of the tasks are energy-draining, then it is time to hire an Exec Ops (formerly called Chief of Staff). 
An Exec Ops has become such an effective hire for the CEOs that I coach that I now require it before coaching someone. I think it's the very first hire that you should make, whether I'm coaching you or not.
Not only does the Exec Ops ensure that your actions get done, but they are also process-oriented and can run the repetitive steps required in a sound management system. They can literally run your company for you. 
Mark Organ, CEO of Influitive, gives a thorough description of CoS best practices in his First Round blog post. To me, the two priorities in creating a great Exec Ops are:
Their background


How you train them
There are several types of Exec Ops.   
A more junior version who does not have ambition to run a department, who only wants to support you.  This person will be your super-charged personal and executive assistant.
A more senior version who does have ambition to run a department, whether a fleshed out Exec Ops with more team members, or to move to running one of the departments in the company.
A very senior version who has enough years of experience that other exec team members will eventually accept reporting to this person.  This version will become your strategic thought-partner and help craft the future vision of the company and the product.  This version can, and will want to, eventually become your COO.
Whatever type you hire first, I think that eventually you will want both a senior version (who can run a department for you) and a junior version who will remain in the Exec Ops for the long-term.
Background. 
The best Exec Ops' are highly organized, excellent communicators (both written and oral), and you simply like spending time with them (because you will be spending a lot of time with them!).
For the more junior version, I recommend someone who is and wants to be a personal and executive assistant.  It is important that they do NOT have an ambition to run their own department or company, as you want this person to stay in this support role for many years.


For the more senior version, you also want them to have broad strategic business knowledge. An environment that almost always ensures these skills is several years at a top management consulting firm (Bain, BCG, and McKinsey). I am partial to Bain, as I find x-Bain consultants also have excellent financial modeling skills (akin to those that they would have learned had they worked as an associate at an investment bank). In addition, it is nice if they have 1-2 years of experience in the tech world to be familiar with current productivity tools. But this is, IMHO, a nice-to-have, not a requirement.  


For the very senior version, you want them to have more years in a consulting firm, or years managing a team (doesn’t need to be a big one) in a tech company. (i.e., 10-15 years of work experience).


The years of work experience don’t confer any real benefit, other than the fact that psychologically it is easier for execs (who are usually in their 30s and 40s) to report to someone who is at least in their 30s. 
Training. 
The key is to give your Exec Ops unfettered access to all the information that you receive. It would be best to have the Exec Ops sit beside you from morning till night, with full access to your emails, calls, meetings, etc. By seeing what decisions you make, based on what information you receive, she will soon be able to think like you, and then she can truly be an extension of you (and magic will happen).


If you are a remote company, it is still important for your Exec Ops to sit with you in person during their training period (the first 3-6 months).  
After that, they can shadow you remotely via a Zoom link that you leave open with screen share on while you are working on solo tasks.
After several weeks of observing, your Exec Ops can start to take tasks off of your plate. Within several months, she will be able to do all the functions that don't give you energy or that you don't have the capacity to do. 
Phil Levine at Golden Gate Recruits is an excellent recruiter for this position, as he is x-Bain and has many contacts in that world.
Another effective recruiting tool is your social media presence. This role is essentially about enthusiasm rather than specific skills. The person is making the trade of being willing to ""do your laundry"" in exchange for getting to watch your life. For that, they need to be a big fan of your life. And if they are, then they most likely already follow you on social media. 
Most senior candidates are not attracted to the Exec Ops role because they view it as an ""assistant"" role. And in many companies, it is. So, when recruiting, dispel this concern by showing the candidate that they will have full access to all the information that you do. And that is the single best training to become a CEO (or head of any department) that exists.
The pushback that I get on this role from CEOs is: 
""Won't I be perceived as an asshole that thinks she's too important to talk to people directly?""
Yes. If you force people to talk to your Exec Ops before they can talk to you. Don't ever do that. Your Exec Ops can draft emails on your behalf. But don't ever allow them to be your gatekeeper (i.e., intercept emails and respond themselves). Communicate with people directly, especially when you need to say ""no"" or make a request.


""I am looking for the perfect person and can't find them.""
Don't wait for perfection here. Pick someone good, and have the Exec Ops start shadowing you. It's the shadowing that is most important as no one will perform on Day 1. They need to shadow you for 30 days before they have enough context to do anything. I therefore encourage you to start that 30-day clock as soon as possible.
At first, the Exec Ops role may seem unattractive to many good candidates. That is because there are two types of Exec Ops. 
One Exec Ops is a glorified gopher. This person does not have access to the CEO's email and does not shadow her in all meetings. Instead, from Day 1, this Exec Ops does the projects that don't fall neatly into any department. While these projects are critical to the company's success, this Exec Ops role has no career plan. There is no clear transition to managing a team or a department, so this role turns off strong candidates. They perceive it as a dead-end.
The other Exec Ops has full access. They see the CEO's email, and, in the beginning, they shadow her in all meetings. In this position, the Exec Ops sees all of the CEO's information and then quickly understands every role and function in the company. For the person in the Exec Ops role, it is the most intense CEO training that exists. Yes, the CEO will ask their Exec Ops to take as much off their plate as possible. At first, this will include simple admin tasks. But there are not very many of those. And this Exec Ops will be authorized to hire whatever support staff they need (their own EA) to complete all of these tasks. That then leaves the Exec Ops to do more significant functions over time. Many Exec Ops in this role eventually either take over the running of a department, or even the people management of the Exec Team (i.e., running the 1-1s and team meetings), making them de facto COO.
If you make it clear that you are offering the latter role, candidates will be far more interested.  
Here is a good perspective of the Chief of Staff role (what I am now calling Exec Ops from a former CoS.

The very senior version of this role is likely:
Chief of Staff

I finally received the first negative feedback on an Exec Ops hire. The Exec Ops had started doing 1-1s with all executive team members, who had shared their frustrations about the founder. The Exec Ops, however, was conflict-avoidant and neither relayed the feedback to the founder nor caused the execs to give the feedback directly. The execs thought that their feedback was being delivered and became even more frustrated when they saw no action or response from the founder.
When I heard this story, I said to the founder: ""That sounds terrible. So, this Exec Ops role has been a bust for you?"" The founder responded: ""Not at all. They have done a great job of helping me run meetings, making sure that everyone is prepared, and following up afterward. Totally worth it.""

When you hire an Exec Ops for the first time, you will likely experience lots of relief once that person begins to take tasks off of your plate (usually within the first 60 days).  This relief will only grow as they fully onboard (3-6 months) and start to jump on bigger and bigger tasks.  At this point, they often take over the management of an ailing department (or two).  They will likely do a great job in this role, but suddenly a new (and very big) problem will arise … they are no longer shadowing you and taking as many minor (but burdensome) tasks off of your plate.  And suddenly your life will get worse.
There is a very easy solution here.  Once you realize that the Exec Ops position is a valuable one (most CEOs realize this at the 2-3 month mark), immediately ask your Exec Ops to hire 1-2 more CoS types.  These new folks will become “Members of the Office of the CEO”.  They will shadow you in the same way that your first Exec Ops does, and they too will be onboarded within 2-3 months.   Now, each team member will be qualified to:
Shadow you consistently and take administrative tasks off of your plate, or
Investigate and solve cross-department issues, or 
Run an ailing department
They can do one or the other well, but not any two.  If your first Exec Ops wants to go run a department, she can.  But not before there is another “Member of the Office of the CEO” ready to take her place as your Exec Ops.
When this happens, your first Exec Ops will likely experience fear that she will no longer be as connected to you, and the trust will eventually erode.  This is just her fear talking, because once the trust is established, it lasts for a very long time.  
Once you have an Exec Ops, make sure that they are regularly recruiting and onboarding more members (who report to the Exec Ops).  These are your smokejumpers.  Don’t ever be left without 1-2 available to you.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
""I'm a huge fan of the Chief of Staff role. Mine runs all OKRs and roadmap planning, and I ask him to do work I otherwise would do before. The latest example is that we had to collect feedback from 15+ people on a meaty set of issues we had to resolve, so he went and spoke with them and shared his notes along with recommended actions. He improves our management system and rolls out changes across the company - e.g., we want to add a new section to company goal meetings, so he'll work with each company goal owner to make sure they do it right. He has a team of 10 people who we dispatch into departments who struggle with our management system or need temp help. His team project manages high-priority cross-functional initiatives like IPO readiness. He and his team (the CEO's office) ensure that we are a well-run company and that I'm not dependent on making that happen consistently across all departments.
I should also add that he was at the company five years before I made him my chief of staff, and nearly everyone on his team has been at the company for at least two years before being on his team, and all show a huge commitment to the culture and are excellent at execution.""
Chris Mansi, CEO of Viz.ai
""I agree with Matt [about not waiting for the ideal background]. I promoted my EA to CoS. She did not have the typical GSB/HBS/McKinsey background, but we did the 30-day shadowing period, and it's been amazing, both for the company and me. It is important that you trust the person completely as you'll likely have them in every meeting you take, including comp/challenging conversations. I also like the idea of promoting from within the org.""

Biz Ops (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WidDWp5710YphCgkE-F6E0yunoaUP9iQKfKMT1EVGgA/edit# ,"Biz Ops

Video of Emilie Choi (Coinbase President and COO) explaining RAPIDs and Biz Ops (20 min)
As your company quickly scales, the young people you hired early in the company's life-cycle will manage bigger and bigger teams. Some will learn to be good managers fast enough. Others won't. 
In dealing with those who don't, you will be in a difficult situation. You want to be transparent with them that they are not succeeding. And then when you decide to ""layer"" them, you will also want to be transparent with them (they will find out anyway once you start recruiting and will feel betrayed if you didn't already inform them) so that they can be your partner in the search. You will likely feel fear that they will feel de-motivated and perform even worse (or leave) before you can hire, train, and onboard their replacement. (This fear is usually overblown, as most young managers look forward to learning from someone more experienced.) But whether or not you feel this fear, the reality is that you want the team's performance to improve now, and recruiting a new manager from the outside will take time. Much more time than you would like. So, how do you improve the team's performance now?
There is an answer.
Large tech companies like Google and Linkedin have created a function called Business Operations. This function is staffed mainly with top-tier consultants from Bain, McKinsey, and BCG. I first encountered Biz Ops at Coinbase, where Emilie Choi scaled the group out as the company was going through hypergrowth. The team was viewed as mini-CEOS who could:
Parachute into any problem area, dig in, and fix it.
Build and drive processes that help the company scale, including running quarterly business reviews, OKRs, etc.
Join a team where the manager was not succeeding, and take over the project and people management duties while keeping the former manager as the architect.
The former manager became the subject matter expert who determined the roadmap: ""These are the things that we need to get done, and this is how to do them.""
The Biz Ops person then managed the team to ensure that they completed the roadmap.
Effectively run any meeting and train managers on how to do so.
Act as Chief of Staff to the CEO.
This function has been a big success for Coinbase. I highly recommend that you create such a function.
One logical way to create this function is first to hire a Chief of Staff (2 min) that fits this spec. Once you have fully trained that person as your CoS, then have them hire another person like them (who reports to them) as the first smoke-jumper. This is now your Biz Ops department. Scale it up from there. 
You may already have a Biz Ops function that reports into Finance or Operations. That is fine. As CEO, you also need a Biz Ops team that reports directly to you and is therefore available to put out any fire in the company, not just those in Finance or Operations. The most efficient structure I have seen is not having another report to the CEO, but rather the CoS to the CEO hiring and managing the overall Biz Ops function. That way, the CEO gets direct access to the function without gaining another report.
It is essential that you always have one Biz Ops resource available. If your CoS or one of the Biz Ops folks wants to manage a department permanently, they may do so. But only after they hire and train their replacement for the CoS or Biz Ops role that they are vacating.
When you send in a smoke-jumper to aid a struggling Manager, it is critical that the Biz Ops person report to that Manager the entire time they are in this position. The role of the Biz Ops person is to make the Manager succeed, not report back what they discover. If, by contrast, the Biz Ops person continues to report to the Head of Biz Ops, the smoke-jumper will be viewed by the struggling Manager as a spy, ensuring a dysfunctional relationship and a bad ending.

Onboarding a new hire (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwrvtGTdhCbxparQ3a4y7Z5RidSHXzsZORoGTubcY3U/edit ,"Onboarding a new hire (3 min)

Video of Matt talking to Ryan Caldbeck (senior exec) about his reaction to shadowing (2 min)

Every position you hire for is already being done by someone in the company right now. The current work will be stretching someone doing it, they may not be performing as well as you want them to, but they are doing it.

Any new hire does not know your company, how you do things or the team dynamics. If you ask the new hire to start the position on Day 1 without context, there is a high probability that they will fail.

Fear not; there is an easy solution.  

For the first 30 days (even better is 60), ask them to shadow the person who is currently doing the job (observing all 1-1s, team meetings, and external meetings). 

After 30 days (or 60), the new hire can then take over. They will now have the full context of what you were doing before and will retain valuable history. They will have strong opinions about improving things, but they will also know what valuable pieces to preserve. They are now highly likely to succeed. 

When they do take over, it is critical that you also shadow them for 2-4 weeks (or as long as you can stand it, because frankly this reverse shadowing will likely be quite boring and painful for you), and give them feedback after each meeting until you realize that they are performing better in the role than you were!!

When reverse-shadowing, it  is key to withhold your feedback until after the meeting so that you don’t interrupt the new hire’s flow.  If you have the discipline to watch a recorded meeting, then an easy way to ensure that you only give feedback after the meeting is to video record the meeting, watch the recording (at 1.5x speed), and then give feedback.  Personally, I do not have this discipline, so I therefore observe the live meeting and simply write down my feedback and share it immediately afterwards.

This technique can be generalized for all Teaching / Training.


Another way of saying this same thing…
To learn about the onboarding process from a Chief of Staff’s point of view, please read: Onboard yourself in 30 days, by Regina Gerbeaux

Everyone I coach, I recommend getting a Chief of Staff (2 min), and almost all have. These Chiefs of Staff are usually young (<30) and therefore relatively inexperienced. They gain the trust of the CEO, perform well, and most end up running entire departments within the company. The success rate among them is close to 100%. 

My coachees also hire new executives. These folks are usually much more experienced, and on paper, much more impressive. Logic dictates that their success rate should be higher than those of the CoS role. Instead, their success rate is about 50%. 

Why is this? I have concluded that it is all about onboarding. We allow the CoS to shadow the CEO for months (gaining full context) before asking them to perform. On the other hand, the executives are usually air-dropped into a live fire (without context) and asked to perform Day 1. 

I ask my CEOs, “If you could wait 30-60 days and bring your new executive success rate from 50% to 100%, would you?” They, of course, all answer, “Yes.” So, we are now implementing the above onboarding methodology.  

This just started in April of 2021. I will update you on the results over the coming months and years. I am enormously optimistic.  

It is November 2021.  The results are starting to come in.  They are all excellent.  BioRender, Vendr, Viz, Belong, Sonder, Vendr have all done this with great success.  More coming soon.  





Feedback

From Regina Gerbeaux, my former Chief of Staff:

Shadowing somewhat resonates with me as someone who went through this process with Matt. I think it was tremendously helpful to onboard by shadowing Matt’s every move. (Things rarely set in for me when I passively observe.) For someone like me, though, I know I learn better by doing versus watching.

Therefore, I think this format (observing for 30-60-90 days) works very specific to how a company functions, but less so for mundane tasks like ordering things, scheduling internal meetings, etc., where the stakes are less high (aka Type 2 tasks or decisions.) I feel most free and like I learned the most when performing the task versus watching, especially when I already know how to do it.

TL;DR:
Shadow for 30 days? YES.  
Observe company-specific things to gain context? YES.  
Observe even mundane, small tasks? NO. Do those myself instead.

From Trishia Pasaquian, my EA:

Yes, it resonates with me. Based on my experience as a new hire, shadowing is the most effective way to learn and gain context of what the company is about, what they do, and how they do it. I’m not sure about the 60 days, but 30 is good. After 30 days, Loom recordings, Notion write-ups, or Tango will do, primarily if some tasks can be taught/discussed during coworking times.

From Sydney Liu, CEO of Commaful:


When we were hiring for our Chief of Staff role, we did paid shadowing as the final step. The final candidates shadowed me for a day and shared their notes about what they observed, learned, found exciting, and what could be improved.


This was a great way to get a feel for what it was like to work with the person while also seeing what they absorbed, how they processed information, what they could do on the job, and how organized they were all in several action-packed hours. We were able to make an informed hire for this role based on this portion of the interview.

Firing Well (updated) (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit ,"Firing Well (updated)

When you do fire someone, put yourself in their shoes. It is a devastating event emotionally. And it is a real setback financially. Your team will also be watching closely to see how you treat ex-employees: a vindictive attitude will make everyone feel unsafe!
Put real effort into helping the person find their next job, and quickly. Give them a severance package that gives them enough time to find another job and have the pay begin realistically. This package is two months minimum, but more realistically, three months or more. And then help them find work within that time frame.
Because you value transparency, make an announcement to the company about the person's departure, or allow the person to do it themselves. When you make the announcement, DO NOT blame or criticize the person. Instead, praise the person's contributions to the company, and take ownership yourself for the fact that you weren't able to match their skills to the company's needs. Either you didn't evaluate well during the recruiting process, or you didn't onboard and train well. Take responsibility for the situation, and explain what you are doing to ensure it doesn't happen again.
It is highly likely that you will be feeling anger toward this person. 
You value the rest of your team much more highly than this person. You will not want to give the person an extra penny. You will want to save those resources for the team that remains that is performing. 
You likely also think, ""This person is a liability. I don't ever want to be associated with this person, and I wouldn't want them associated with my name ever again.""
Feel this anger, and then let it pass. 
Recognize that you have a responsibility here. Your recruiting, training and management helped create this situation. It is your responsibility to help the person find a job and a better fit company. If you want to save your company's resources, then help them find that job more quickly. And then turn to your recruiting, training, and managing processes, and ask yourself: ""What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""
Recognize that this person did not have the skills or behaviors you needed, but they have passions. Find out what those passions are. Behind those passions are likely excellent skills. Help the person determine what role (it may not be in the business world) would be a great fit for them. What would their dream job be? Then become their agent, and help them land that dream job. Do exactly what an agent does:
Interview them to discover what their ideal role is. Match that ideal against your knowledge of their skills/passions to actual roles available to determine a real job that they would enjoy and be good at.

Create a written description of the person and their talents. If OKed by the person, post it on your social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) with your written endorsement of the candidate. Ask interested employers to contact the person directly. 
Offer to send a message of recommendation if the candidate gets past a first-round interview at a company. Use LinkedIn to discover who you know at that company.
I have found that the message of endorsement works one time and usually moves the candidate to the next stage. You can either use the bullet to get the candidate an interview or use it after the first interview to land them the job itself. The latter is much more valuable.
If you do this, not only will you be doing the right thing and taking responsibility for your actions, but you will also create a culture of safety in your company. 
It will put your remaining team at ease (allowing them to perform better at their job), and news of this culture will spread quickly so that soon your Glassdoor reviews will rise. This action, in turn, will make your company a far more desirable place to work, and your rate of offer acceptance will go up dramatically.


It will ease pressure during the recruiting process. If you and your team know that you have a humane approach to letting people go, you can take a bit more risk on people with great potential but little experience during the recruiting process. And those often end up being the best performers.


It will allow you to let underperformers go sooner because you won't dread the trauma of the firing process. There will be no trauma. 


You may even go to the Jack Welch model outlined here: Comms, Internal: Announcing traumatic events
Yes, doing the right thing often pays for itself several times over!
I call the process above ""Firing Well."" If you learn how to do it, you benefit from a happier culture, a bolder hiring process, and a much more effective performance management system. All of these will strengthen your team and your company.

Some video examples:

Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in “Moneyball” (3 min)

How to announce to the person?
First, read Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min).
Let the person know …
This will be a difficult conversation.  You will likely feel sadness, anger and fear.
I am letting you go.  
This decision is not changeable
This is why 
Here is what I did to create this situation
I am going to help you in the following ways 
I will be your agent in finding your next job
I am giving you ___ months severance, which they will receive upon …
Transferring key information back to the company
Signing your offboarding documents
Today is your last day (unless more time is required to transfer key information)
The reason for this is that it minimizes the time that everyone lingers in the sadness of saying goodbye.  
The remainder of today is hopefully enough time to say goodbye.
After hearing this, I imagine that you are feeling anger, fear and sadness.  Would you be willing to share your thoughts with me?
(Repeat back what they share with you.  This helps reduce their anger from dangerous levels.)
How to announce to the company?
Any change in the organizational structure, be it terminations or reporting changes, causes trauma to the organization. And anytime there is the potential for trauma, it is essential to:
Be transparent with the entire organization


Give each person a chance to release their fear or anger
To do this:
Announce the org change in the group meeting (usually All Hands)
Schedule 1-1s for each person shortly after the group meeting. These can be the regularly-scheduled 1-1s that each manager has with their reports.


Have each manager directly ask each report in the 1-1 if they feel fear or anger about the org change. If they are, allow them to fully release their thoughts and feelings.  See Heard: how to make people feel it (2 min) for how to do this.

Saying Goodbye to a Teammate (2 min) (Trishia Pasaquian),https://www.notion.so/mocharymethod/Saying-Goodbye-to-a-Teammate-c256b6c72f7c463f8ec586dd58c3b535,"# Saying Goodbye to a Teammate

<aside>
👋🏼 *Saying goodbye to a teammate is never easy. Whether it’s due to a teammate leaving for another job, retirement, or any other circumstance — saying farewell can be difficult and emotional.*

*It’s natural for those of us who have worked closely with someone over the years to feel a sense of loss when they are no longer part of our team.*

</aside>

### There are a few things to keep in mind when saying goodbye to a teammate:

### 👉🏼 **It is important to be respectful and to be understanding that this person is leaving - whether they’re leaving on their own accord or being let go.**

### 👉🏼 **If the person is being let go and you’ve already informed them of your decision (in 1:1), as a manager, give them some time to process the news and process their emotions.**

- Hearing this news can be devastating emotionally and financially for the person being let go. **It’s important to hold a safe space for the person to digest the news and first, process their fear or anger, or sadness, and then let them shift out of it.**
    - The time varies for everyone but it usually takes a day or two for them to really process.

### 👉🏼 **Bi-directionality is crucial when someone is leaving the team.**

- **Notify the team the same day that the person finds out - their end date, so it’s not a surprise to the team.** State the reason, to an extent that’s appropriate  - do not disclose private information.
    - The best thing is for the employment to end the same day as the person finds out they no longer have a job at MM. Having them stay after that point is not healthy for anyone. So, the person's last day is the day that they get the news. This should also be the day that the rest of the team gets the news as well.
- **Let the teammate announce the news themselves in the [#team-announcements](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C01AGLFTLKD) channel in Slack.**
    - Encourage them to give their farewells, leave their contact information, and tell the what they’re was up to next.

### 👉🏼 E**xpress gratitude for the time spent together.** There are a few ways to do this:

- **Block a time, say 10mins, in an all-hands meeting or the closest team meeting for everyone to celebrate the person** by:
    - Thank them for their contributions.
    - Acknowledge what they will be missed most of.
    - Offer well-wishes for their future endeavors.
- **Have a farewell lunch or happy hour.** If location and time permits, it can be valuable to hold an in-person gathering to eat out with the team to celebrate the person.
- If a sync meeting is not possible due to distributed time zones, you can opt to:
    1. **Write a farewell card or email where the team can share their love and appreciation for the person.** The manager can organize this and send it on their last day. That way, everyone starts humble and leaves grateful.
        - It could be in a message format or people can send a screenshot of what most represents the person leaving in their mind. Examples of this would be a slack message, a photo, a meme, work output, etc. These can be organized into a digital card/board.
    2. **This could also be in a video format.** People can individually record a loom/video celebrating the teammate and combine it as a company farewell with good wishes.
    3. **Send them off with a farewell gift (e.g. gift card, gift basket, etc.) as a token of appreciation for all they have done.**

### 👉🏼 Offer support if they need help transitioning into their new role or team.

- **Add the teammate to [#z-mm-alumni](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C04B8G1U9BM) (Mochary Method Alumni Channel) on Slack.** This is a quick and efficient way to stay in touch and check in with them from time to time.
- **Connecting on LinkedIn** will help you stay in touch after they leave so you can remain updated on each other's progressions throughout your careers—and even if there isn't an opportunity now, staying connected may lead to something great down the road!

### 👉🏼 Make sure that the team doesn't neglect themselves during these tough times.

- **Offer to do quick 1:1s with teammates individually** to hold space for them to talk about how they’re feeling about this person leaving, ask questions they might have, and make them feel heard and understood."
Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit ,"Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A's (4 min)
If you want to receive accurate, honest feedback and improve and keep your team communicating, YOU must make an effort to seek it. 
Do so using the five A's:
1. Ask for it: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished but cherished. It is essential to say this to them explicitly. 
But that alone is not enough.  You need to actively pull feedback from each person. They will be reluctant to share at first. 
For them, it is an asymmetric bet in the negative direction. If you take the feedback well, you will positively change your behavior, resulting in a +1. If, however, you accept the feedback badly, then you may become vindictive and try to destroy the person, which for them would be a negative 100. Most rational people will not make this wager. 
Therefore, you must be creative in extracting negative feedback for the first time so that you get a chance to prove that you will receive it well.
Lachy Groom recommended a feedback method that I use often. I ask the person: ""Please don't say it, just think it. What is the thought you have that you are afraid to tell me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Again, please don't say it; just think about it. Do you have it in your brain chamber?"" If they respond ""Yes,"" then I say, ""OK, now please say it.""
I also let my reports know that I will think that they are simply withholding until they share negative feedback with me, and I won't fully trust them. 
It would not be enough for me to say, ""Give me feedback anytime."" None of my reports would ever actually create the time and space to do so, as it feels aggressive to push for this agenda item. Instead, I must carve out this time and space. I do so in the last 5-10 minutes of every meeting, whether 1-1 or team meeting. And I do it in writing (I ask each participant to write down their feedback to me in real-time in our shared Doc) so that I can refer back to it forever. And once they do give me this negative feedback, I then create a recurring space for them to give it to me from then on. I recommend that you do the same.
Many meeting owners send a survey after the meeting asking for feedback. Please recognize that this is close to useless. Most people will not carve out the time to do so, nor be motivated to give honest feedback as they have no idea if it will be read or understood. 
2. Acknowledge it. Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what your colleague said or wrote. Put yourself in their perspective, and say it as if you are them talking to you. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say ""Yes,"" you can move on. If they say ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have summarized what they said correctly, you can even go deeper by saying, ""There’s more.  Please tell me more.""  Keep repeating the cycle until they say, “That’s everything.”
If you want to go to the advanced level, also describe the emotions they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the feeling yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they fear you will get angry (and then become vindictive) if they say what they think. So they have toned down their thoughts when saying them. If you tone it down even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will feel safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""


What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
Acknowledging is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People need to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is actually more impactful than acting on their feedback.
To confirm that you have done this correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""
This process is explained in more detail in Heard:  how to make people feel it (3 min).
3. Appreciate it. Say ""Thank you"" for the precious gift that your team is giving you. Don't make excuses. Don't argue back. Just say, ""Thank you.""
4. Accept it (or not). Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback.  If you had to accept all feedback, it would become tyranny of the feedback-giver.  And we never want that.

You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not accept (i.e., that you disagree with philosophically). If so, please explain why.  Bring us into your world.  Make us see why this feedback doesn’t make sense for you. 

If you do accept it, however, then move on to step 5.
5. Act on it. Co-create an action item that will effectively address the feedback. Put a due date on it. Do it. And then let the feedback-giver know that you did the action. When you do, you will have completed the feedback loop. And the feedback-giver will then have gained trust that you want feedback and are committed to improving. Publish this feedback and action item widely to the organization. Only then will your team members feel confident that you hear their voices and that it is safe to give you further feedback."

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about giving and receiving feedback (5 min)
Receiving
Frequent, transparent feedback is critical for building a strong culture and a thriving business. Feedback is instrumental in building trust. Without trust, communication breaks down. Building a culture of feedback and transparency starts and ends with the founders.
Critical feedback, in particular, should be cherished. Your team members are in the trenches every day. They have knowledge about the company that you do not have. Only if you open up the door to negative feedback will your team feel comfortable giving it. 
Think about it from the other side—it can be quite scary to criticize someone who has power over them. They might feel they're risking their job! 
If you do not proactively collect feedback, you will quickly find the following problems emerge:
You will be in the dark about your company's problems: If you act defensively every time your team brings up an issue, they will soon stop bringing that valuable information to you, and you will wither away in your ivory tower.
Operations will grind to a halt: When people cannot share things openly, communication breaks down; when communication breaks down, operations slow. This problem only gets worse as your company grows, and as it grows, it becomes even harder to change that culture.
Your best talent will leave you: A-players have no patience for defensiveness and amateurishness. If you aren't mature enough to listen to your people, face your problems, and work on fixing them, your A-players will find the founders who listen.
Therefore, if you are to receive real, honest feedback and improve and keep your team communicating, YOU must make an effort to seek it out. Do so using the five A's:
1. Ask for it: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished but cherished. It is essential to say this, preferably in a one-on-one setting. When asking for feedback on the company in general, it is helpful to ask, ""If you were CEO, what would you change?"" You can do this in person or through an anonymous survey. 
When asking for feedback about himself as a manager, Lachy Groom, formerly of Stripe, asks, ""What feedback are you afraid to give because you think it will hurt my feelings? Please tell me that."" Even then, many people hesitate. I like to add, ""Don't tell me. Please think about it. Do you have it in your brain chamber? Yes? Now please tell me."" 
Let your reports know that until they share truly negative feedback with you, you will think that they are simply withholding, and you won't be able to trust them fully. 
Note: It is not enough to say, ""Give me feedback anytime."" None of your reports will ever actually create the time and space to do this. Instead, you must create this time and space. I do so in the last 5-10 minutes of every meeting I am in, whether 1-1 or team meeting. And I do it in writing (I ask each participant to write down their feedback to me in real-time in our shared Doc) so that I can refer back to it forever. I recommend that you do the same.
Many meeting owners send a survey after the meeting asking for feedback. Please recognize that this is close to useless. People will not carve out the time to do so. And will not be motivated to give honest feedback as they have no idea if it will be read or understood. 
2. Acknowledge it. Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say ""Yes,"" you can proceed. If they say ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""
If you want to go to the advanced level, also describe the emotions they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the feeling yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they are fearful that if they say what they think, you will get angry (and then become vindictive). So they have toned down their thought when saying it. If you tone it down even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will be safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""
What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
This action is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is more impactful than acting on their feedback.
To confirm that you have done this correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""
3. Appreciate it. Simply say ""Thank you"" for the precious gift that your colleague is giving you. Don't make excuses. Don't argue back. Just say, ""Thank you.""
4. Accept it (or not). Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback. You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not take (i.e., that you disagree with philosophically). If so, explain why. If you do accept it, however, then …
5. Act on it. Co-create an action item that will effectively address the feedback. Put a due date on it. Do it. And then let the feedback-giver know that you did the action. When you do, you will have completed the feedback loop. And the feedback-giver will then have gained trust that you want feedback and are committed to improving. Publish this feedback and action item widely to the organization. Only then will your team members feel confident that you hear their voices and safe enough to give you further feedback.
Giving 
First, when giving feedback, it is critical to use a two-way communication method (in person is best, a video call is okay, an audio call is least good). This method is so that you can see the person's reaction. If they get defensive and angry, you will be able to see that and say: ""I didn't intend to make you feel angry. I intended to be helpful."" This step will hopefully mollify their anger.
If, on the other hand, you use a one-way communication method (email, text, voicemail), then the recipient can quickly become defensive and angry without you realizing it. And because you don't notice the anger, you won't be able to address it. Unaddressed, that anger will soon turn into resentment towards you. Therefore, do NOT use a one-way communication method (email, text, voicemail) to give feedback unless it is 100% positive. There is one exception to this rule: If you already know (without a doubt) the person to be open, curious, and desirous of critical feedback.
Second, it is critical to always affirm the positive value of the relationship (i.e., ""I value you because you …"" or ""I like that you did ....""). Yes, every time you give someone feedback. 
Third, before giving critical feedback, write it down first (on a doc only you have access to). Why? Because in the moment, it is often challenging to give clear critical feedback. We feel fear, our brain tells us to withhold (after all, we like this person and don't want to hurt their feelings), and then we often can't get the message across fully or clearly. 
Fourth, phase in the way that you give critical feedback. In the first few meetings where you give critical feedback (after you have affirmed the relationship), give it verbally (i.e., read your notes). As you give feedback, watch the person. If you see that they become tense or get triggered … stop. Reassure them that your intent is not to criticize or attack. Rather you value them and want them to succeed to their fullest potential. Do not continue until they release their fear or anger (which can take a few days).
Once a person can appreciate verbal feedback, then in the next few meetings where you deliver critical feedback, copy/paste your feedback into a shared doc during the session and have them read it in front of you. Watch the person as they do. If they get triggered, stop them and reassure them that your feedback is intended as a gift.
Once the person can appreciate written feedback, you can move on to giving them feedback asynchronously. But know that this is a dangerous step. If they ever get triggered, you won't be able to see it and reassure them of your positive intent. Personally, I never share critical feedback asynchronously, no matter how open someone is. 
There are three levels of feedback that you can give:
Relative
Absolute
Deep (emotion-based)
Relative Feedback
This step is simple feedback that allows the recipient to gain confidence in what they are doing well, and hear steps to improve.
Here is the template:
Like. ""I like that you did …"" This should be an action that occurred, not a generic character trait. 
Good example: ""You said hello to me when I walked in the door yesterday.""
Bad example: ""You are nice.""


Wish That. ""I wish that you would do…."" Again, this should be a specific positive action. 
Good example: ""Say goodbye to me whenever you leave the room.""
Bad example: ""Don't be rude.""
Absolute Feedback
Matt talking about the importance of Absolute Feedback and how to give it (3 min)
People also need to know where they stand on an absolute basis. Do not wait until year-end Performance Reviews. Most people have constant anxiety when they aren't sure where they stand. Giving absolute feedback regularly (usually monthly in a 1-1) will eliminate this anxiety. Bad news is less anxiety-inducing than no news.
To give it, state:
Your current rating for your job function, 1-5, is … 
3 is “meeting expectations”
4 is “exceeding expectations”
5 is “OMG, it couldn’t be any better”
2 is “below expectation and I am now putting you on a written 30-day Performance Improvement Plan”
1 is “it couldn’t be any worse and I am now letting you go.”
What you did that I liked is ...
What you need to do to get to the next level is …

Absolute feedback:  example
Deep (emotions-based) Feedback
Finally, there is deep emotion-based feedback. Do this when there is more time (offsite).
Here is a template for providing this feedback, adapted from the book Nonviolent Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg.
Ask for permission. Give the receiver a little heads-up of what's coming. It can be enough to say 
""I have something to communicate to you, is now a good time?""


Do you value this relationship? If yes, please state why. 
""I value this relationship because …."", or
""I feel joy when I see you ....""


State your emotion in terms of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and excitement (feeling). This step is perhaps the most challenging part for you to do. Talking about your feelings might not be something you are used to, so it might be challenging at first. However, doing so is crucial for the other person to truly understand where you are coming from and take your feedback to heart. You may think, I'm not angry, I'm just frustrated. Well, that is just a lesser version of anger. Just as all colors are primarily red, yellow, and blue, all emotions are a version or mixture of the base emotions listed above.
""I feel anger."" |


State the facts as you perceive them (facts). Be very careful to state only pure facts, as a video camera would record them. (This is a challenge for many people to do. Keep it very short. If it is hard for you, simply skip this step and go right to Story.) An example of not fact: ""You disrespected me."" An example of fact: 
""You walked in the door this morning, and I did not hear you say hello.""


Now, state the thoughts, opinions, and judgments (Story) you have around this situation. 
""The thought that I have is ...."", or
""The story that I am telling myself is …."" 


If you want to go to the advanced level (see explanation in the next section below), describe what you did to create this situation. 
""I helped create this situation by ….""


Request what you would like to see. Try to frame it as positive action (""do x"") rather than a negative (""don't do y""). 
""I request that you ….""


Ask if the person accepts the feedback and the request. If yes, then hold them accountable for doing it.
Giving and receiving frequent and transparent feedback may be painful at first. Often when companies start implementing this, it brings up a lot of underlying resentment and repressed issues. However, if you hang in there, you will find that the amount and intensity of feedback diminish substantially, and your team will be noticeably happier and more productive. 
The next level of giving feedback (whether Relative, Absolute, or Deep) is recognizing your part in creating the situation. If you view each issue as caused by others or things outside of you, you will feel and act like a victim and give away your power to create the world you want to live. Conversely, if you are willing to articulate how you helped create the situation, you take back your control. You will more clearly see how you can change the current situation and prevent the situation from happening again in the future.
To do this, in Deep feedback, before making a request, state: ""I helped create this situation by …."" Then write out (or say) all the steps needed to create this situation. 
In conscious leadership terminology, we call this ""taking 100% responsibility.""
When you ask for feedback from someone for the first time, they may say, ""I have no critical feedback for you; you're great."" If so, then either they think you're perfect, or they are withholding from you. (Which one do you think it is?) In this case, you can supply the thought for them, and ask if you are close: ""I have a story in my head that you are feeling anger and the thought that you are having is 'Screw Jim, he never gives me clear written direction and then gets mad when things don't turn out the way that he had envisioned.' Is that close?"" This prompt will often get the person to say: ""Yes, that's right."" or ""No, what I'm actually thinking is ….""
One of the most common issues that I hear from Managers of why they don't want to give transparent feedback:
""Person X on my team is not performing well. But there is no one else that can do their job. I plan to hire someone to replace X eventually. But in the meantime, if I give X real and honest feedback, I am afraid that they will quit, and then I'll be totally screwed.""
This situation is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you do not give someone feedback, then, by definition, that person will fail.
If, however, you give feedback as a gift (using the script above), then the receiver will likely receive it well, and one of two magical things will happen:
They will work hard to improve and perform the way that you hope, or
They will admit that they cannot perform the job and actively help you find their replacement.
Withholding feedback is never the best answer!
A note on expressing feelings:
When you give clear feedback, the receiver may cry. This reaction is not a bad sign. For many people, crying is a very effective way of releasing emotion. Allow the person the space to cry. Be okay with it. Just breathe. Don't try to stop their crying or cut it off by talking to them or putting your hand on their shoulder. Instead, allow them to cry as long as they need to (rarely lasts more than 1-2 minutes). Once they finish, they will feel much better, and you can both proceed productively. 

If we make it not okay to cry, then people have no way of releasing their emotions, and then that emotion becomes a bad mood.
Mathilde Colin from Front has written up her advice on giving and receiving feedback. It is similar to what's written above, but there are valuable differences as well. 
Question: ""People tell me that I am too abrasive when I give feedback. How do I deliver feedback in a way that people are open to hearing it without feeling hurt?""
There have been several innovations in feedback delivery. 
The first was to share positive feedback before sharing any negative feedback. ""You did this thing really well. This other thing, however, was not good.""
The second was sharing what to do, as opposed to what not to do. ""The next time you do this action, please do it this way ….""
The third was to not state as judgments but rather share feelings, thoughts, and requests. ""When you did …, I felt frustrated,"" ""The thought that I had was….,"" ""My request is….""
Reed Hastings of Netflix has landed upon the latest (and IMHO best) iteration so far. When giving feedback, he does not act in anger, nor does he state how he feels. Instead, he says what he thinks needs to happen (positive example) and why it will lead to the company's success and the person's success (rather than Reed himself no longer feeling anger). 
To me, therefore, best practice is
State what the person is doing that you like
State what other thing you would like to see the person do, in positive terms (""Please do this,"" not ""Don't do that"")
Explain why this way of doing things will lead to the company and person's success

Restoration and Creativity:  how to achieve them (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUU3WVCsXKBLx0IUZoz9K939khuDV5VUD7grBgJ5Wis/edit ,"Restoration and Creativity:  how to achieve them (3 min)
Most CEOs that I coach, when I first meet them, are working 14 hour days. If they have a spouse and children, they then spend another few hours connecting with them. The rest of the time, they sleep but never enough. 
The obvious cost of this lifestyle is that it leaves little if any time for the brain to turn off and restore. 
The unobvious cost is that the brain is not fully creative (or creative at all) when it has no time to be distraction-free.
All CEOs need mental rest. And all of them need to be creative to envision (and document) the future of their product or service.
So, how do you get mental rest and become creative while also working 14 hours a day?
The answer is: find ways to get bored. Small ways and big ways. 
Let me explain.
We are naturally in a mentally restorative and creative state until we introduce distractions. And modern life is nothing but distractions, both work and pleasure. On the work side: responding to messages, being in meetings, etc. On the pleasure side: watching videos or social media posts. All give us small hits of adrenaline, which temporarily feel good.  But they also put our brains in alert status (amygdala) to see what comes next, with no capacity for creative thought. And the constant adrenaline doesn't allow our minds to rest and restore. 
When we remove these distractions, we at first feel bored (for some people this feeling is almost unbearable).  But if we allow ourselves to sit with this state and simply let it be, then eventually we start to feel a sense of mental relaxation.  And then our creative thoughts begin to flow.
To achieve this state, we truly need to experience NO DISTRACTIONS. That means turning off all sources of distraction. Certainly all electronic sources (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.). As well as all inbound requests for information: email, text, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.
You can do this for a few minutes (whenever you use the restroom), 30-60 minutes (when you have a meal), two days (the weekend), or a week (a restorative vacation or staycation).
All of these have value. The key to each is allowing yourself to get bored. And in the beginning, you won't enjoy it. You are physically addicted to distraction and the adrenaline that it delivers. Give yourself time to get unaddicted. On the other side, you will find restoration and creativity. 
Start with something small. Simply delete your social media apps, and commit to putting your phone away (in another room) whenever you are using the restroom, eating, or drinking. During that time, simply sit with your thoughts. Take your food and beverages outside if you can (to eliminate further the distraction of seeing your workspace). Stare at the leaves swaying in the wind while you eat and drink. 
Try this for 30 days. It is a low-cost experiment, as you aren't getting real work done when eating, drinking, and using the restroom anyway. See if you feel more or less restored and creative than you did in the previous 30 days.
If you feel more so, then step up your experimentation and try longer stints distraction-free. Try an entire weekend disconnected. If that feels good (and it will!), then schedule an entire week disconnected. And if that feels good, then make all of this a regular practice. Put it on your calendar.
All meals entirely disconnected.
One weekend a month entirely disconnected. 
One week a quarter entirely disconnected.
That investment alone will reap huge rewards for your mental peace and the company's ability to see the future.

This works for artistic creativity as well. I once coached a well-known musician. He came to me because he needed to write the songs for his new album, but no creativity would flow. He would go into the studio each afternoon after a day of meetings and responding to emails. He couldn't quiet his mind from the day's activities, so he started taking a few stiff drinks. This action calmed his mind a bit, but not enough. And the drinks were starting to take a toll on his body. What to do?
The answer: we simply applied the philosophy above. We arranged for him to rent a studio in another part of the country (where no one would know where to find him) for ten days, turn off all messaging and entertainment apps, have with him only the key people he needed to function (i.e., to get food and drink, collaborate on the music production, etc.), no drugs or alcohol, and allow himself to simply get bored. 
He called me after the ten days and said: ""Matt, it was incredible. I was more creative than I've ever been. I wrote and recorded the best songs of my life, and I know this album will be a huge hit. I cannot thank you enough. In hindsight, it makes so much sense. Every artist should be doing this.""
The album has now been released.  It is indeed a hit.


Matteo Franceschetti, CEO of EightSleep: 
 
“This is a game-changer.  I call it Stillness.  I just sit doing nothing and let my monkey mind go everywhere.  At the beginning the monkey is crazy.  Then the monkey starts slowing down, and clarity comes.  When I am on vacation, I make sure to do Stillness at least 1 hour per day.  Stillness is the vacation.  And now I am forcing myself to do at least 10 minutes per day when I am working.  In the first minutes, I keep moving my arm to grab my phone.  But eventually my mind stills, and I feel peace.  It is a game-changer.”

"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LLfA6TgDoynzduB-2Xp0XHmMN5lUiRxx8ht3VjYJ0E/edit ,"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)

With the advent of forced remote, many CEOs find that some of their team members are profoundly unhappy. They see this when valued team members choose to leave the 500+ person company and move to another job, most often to an organization with just a few people (early startup or investment firm), or to no job at all. This move often appears illogical. The person is giving up lots of compensation. The CEO often feels personally insulted and undoubtedly confused. 
There is no need to be confused. The reasons are actually logical. 
In this remote world, many people feel disconnected, which leads to sadness, often intense sadness (i.e., depression). Those in this state know that something needs to change, but they are not sure what. Their job is the activity that consumes most of their day, so they often assume the cause lies. They believe that their disconnection comes from the fact that they are working at a ""big company."" If they leave for a small company, they will regain a sense of connection. 
Unfortunately, they rarely do because their disconnection is not coming from the company's size but rather how they are working remotely. 
Most managers feel that they are not allowed to ask about a report's personal life, and therefore are unwilling to ask about the report's home environment and daily routines. This tactic is a mistake. The manager is a coach whose role is to help their report unpack and solve the issues that the report faces, whether they appear in their work or personal world. 
Therefore, as a manager, if you sense that one of your reports is unhappy or experiencing mental/emotional pain, ask them about it. Ask them about their home environment and daily routine. I posit that you will likely discover that they do not do or have at least one of the following:
Get outside
See other people that they know
Exercise
Have access to a consistently uninterrupted space to take Zoom calls
I posit that humans need four things to feel mentally balanced:
Connection to nature
Connection to tribe
Blood flow
Uninterrupted workspace
Pre-COVID, we could each achieve these to some degree simply by going to an office. 
We had to leave our residence each day to get to transportation which brought us to and from the office. By leaving our home, we encountered outside air, even if only briefly, which created a connection to nature.
We saw other people in the office who were familiar to us. They may not have been our best friends, but we knew them. We said hello and goodbye, maybe had lunch with them, perhaps even met for drinks after work, and shared an occasional laugh. This action created a connection to a tribe.
We had to physically walk to transport, which got our bodies moving a little bit and thus our blood flowing a bit. Many of us took advantage of being out by going to the gym and really getting our blood to flow.
The design of the modern office is for performance, with call booths, conference rooms, or private offices for meetings and calls. Thus, we had uninterrupted workspaces.
We achieved these things unwittingly. 
Rather than convince you that these elements create a feeling of peace and satisfaction, I challenge you to experiment with them. 
Naturally, going to an in-person office gave us each of these to a small degree. Suppose we are intentional about creating them in a work-from-home environment. In that case, we can achieve them to a much higher degree, and therefore feel even greater personal satisfaction than we did when going to the office. 
Here is how I do it:
Connection to nature. 
I take a 5-minute walk outside at the beginning of the day before I start work. And I take a 5-minute walk at the end of the day once I have stopped work. 
My walk not only creates a connection to nature by getting me into the outside air, but it also is a nice signal of the transition to and from work. Before the morning and after the evening transition, I do not allow myself to work, leaving me space to focus on family and personal activities. 
I also take breaks regularly throughout the day. I only schedule 25- and 50-minute meetings, and I end all of them on time. This schedule allows me a break to go to do one or more of the following: 
go to the bathroom
get a drink of water
get a snack
get outside
prepare for the next meeting 


When I get outside (which I do at least once every 2 hours), I 
Close my eyes and face the sun (even if it's cloudy) for 1 minute. This moment creates an intense and quick connection to nature.
While doing so, I stretch my hip flexors while taking five deep breaths. This stretch gets my blood flowing.
Then I find my wife or one of my children and give them a 1-minute hug. (Truth be told, only my wife puts up with this. My kids top out at 10 seconds when they are willing to hug me at all.) Hugs create an intense and quick connection to my tribe.
Connection to tribe: 
In addition to the 1-minute hugs mentioned above, I schedule in-person socially-distant gatherings at least once a week. 
I put zero effort into hosting. I am only willing to send an email stating the time and location of the gathering. 
Sometimes it is at an open-air restaurant/bar for a drink or meal. Sometimes it is on my patio where each guest must bring whatever they want to drink or eat. 
My intent is not to be rude but rather to make organizing and hosting incredibly easy for me, increasing the likelihood that I will continue to do so. 
The purpose of these gatherings for me is laughter. I invite those with whom I can generate that laughter. 
Blood flow 
In addition to the short walks at the beginning and end of the day and the 1-minute breaks, I run on the treadmill. But rather than see how much I can do, I have experimented with how little I can do and still get the benefit of a feeling of peace and calm in my body that lasts for more than 24 hours. For me, that time is 3 minutes at 4.0 speed. I run for 5 minutes to be safe. 
Once again, my goal is to make this step so easy (i.e., short and slow) that there is no reason for me not to do it each day. 
I should note that I often skip the morning walk in favor of the 5 minutes on the treadmill because my treadmill is in an unattached garage, so I have to go outside to get to it. Thus, I am getting my connection to nature anyway. 
Uninterrupted workspace 
I have converted a back room into a Zoom studio. It is far from the locus of kids' activities, and I can lock the door so that no one accidentally wanders in. 
Many of your team members do not have a large enough home, or an unused room, to create such an uninterrupted space. The answer for them is either of the following. 
A co-working space outside the home 
Rent a home in a less expensive part of the country to afford a larger space. 
I recommend that the company provide a rent stipend for either a co-work space or a remote residence.
My wife and I have hired a homeschool teacher to be with our children. 
Many of your team members cannot afford to do this on their own. For them, you can: 
Change the culture in the company. Re-frame a child walking into a Zoom call as a welcome introduction of the team member's family to their co-workers. Ask the meeting owner to look forward to these moments to increase team bonding by getting to know each other as humans. 
Do what Gitlab does and create Juicebox Zoom calls that bring families together for remote playdates throughout the day and introduce them to children in many locations that they would otherwise never have access.
Encourage parents to partner with other families to create a micro-school (hire a teacher jointly).
With these steps above, I feel connected, grounded, and peaceful throughout the day. Even when I have back-to-back-to-back Zoom calls throughout the day, I feel energized as long as I actually take a break between each call and get outside during those breaks.
Other things contribute to my sense of well-being. They are:
Desk set-up:
I have a standing desk. Because of it, my neck, back, and body do not get sore or stiff. (Before I had a standing desk, I used a neck pillow with pressure knobs for a few minutes during breaks and at the end of the day to relieve the tension in my neck and back.)
I have placed my desk directly in front of a window. This location achieves two purposes: 
It allows me to look outside at nature throughout the day. I also open the window to allow in fresh air when the weather cooperates. This step gives me a connection to nature.
The natural light on my face is akin to professional video lighting, allowing me to appear fully present during video calls. 
Morning routine:
I follow Tim Ferriss's morning routine suggestion. 
Meditate for 10 minutes (while still in bed) using the Waking Up app.
Journal (while still in bed) using the 5-Minute Journal. 
Make my bed. 
Drink a large glass of water. 
3-minute run on the treadmill.
Every other day, I do push-ups using the Just 6 Weeks app.


This 20 minute routine invigorates me and launches me with energy and clarity into the day's tasks.
Meals:
I try to eat every meal and snack sitting outside with no phone.
Entertainment:
I try (with decent success) not to look at an electronic device for entertainment. This change means that I no longer look at my phone to view news, Twitter, YouTube, etc.


Without electronic entertainment, I force myself to do other activities during non-work times. I end up: 
Sitting outside and staring at the leaves blowing in the wind (intense connection to nature)
Talking with my wife (connection to tribe)
Talking and playing with my kids (connection to tribe)
Reading a paper book (soothing)


These activities bring me a sense of peace, whereas looking at my phone or a screen never does.
Time away:
I do not work at all on the weekends, guaranteeing myself two days of rejuvenation each week. And I take a long weekend with my family once every few months. 


Plaid recently looked at vacation days and found that their team members weren't taking them … at all. So, Plaid scheduled two 4-day weekends for 2H20. During these long weekends, no one at Plaid is allowed to work. (Of course, Plaid can't stop the sales team from responding to emails. But hopefully, they will be doing so from a lovely location.)


I recommend that you do the same.
Please think of these suggestions as experiments. There are many other ways to connect to nature, connection to tribe, blood flow, and uninterrupted workspace. 
Find the ways that work for you. Make sure that you do them every day and several times each day. 
And as a Manager, make sure that your reports are doing so as well. If you do, I posit that you and your team members will retain a lasting sense of connection, peace, and well-being. And your team members will therefore stay with the company.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
""While it is often worth digging into someone's personal life, be aware that there is a risk, and this is not a universal positive. Some people will feel offended if you pressure them to reveal personal details. Instead, invite the conversation if people accept, great. If not, that's fine too.
I'm not sure that I buy that people get connected to nature by taking an Uber. But I agree that it is critical to avoid the claustrophobia of staying indoors for days. 
The recommendations above are very specific. They are one way to be happy. There are many other ways. 
One minute is a long time for a hug!
We need to update this process for a post-COVID world.”

Finding play (5 min),https://mm-coaches.notion.site/Finding-play-302e4f87286a4947a88e0a4d1565dea6 ,"# Finding play

by [Sabrina Wang](https://sabrina-wang.super.site/) ([@sabrinawangzq)](https://twitter.com/sabrinawangzq)

Play has no intended outcome. Play happens out of joy and curiosity. It doesn’t seek any external goal or validation.

Life starts with play. As we grow up, many of us forget about it. 

It’s being present and curious. At some point, we are taught to pursue certain progressions in life, like money, family, and a good life. We are taught that the way to get there is through hard work and following rules. Play gets a bad name. It has the connotation of not-serious and counter-productive.

Play is not just for kids. It’s a personalized and unique key to unlock everyone’s Zone of Genius.

Life as a CEO is more like a marathon than a sprint. What if you ask yourself, “How can I make this life more fun?”

When you start playing more in your business, it will make your life better. You will lead with curiosity and joy versus your ego. Conscious leadership is play, because play is understanding oneself, listening, and responding. 

---

I once coached a CEO who was on the brink of selling her company.  She was constantly stressed and exhausted and found herself never present with her loved ones during non-work hours.  Together, we made the discovery that her life was all work, goals, and responsibilities — no play.

The first form of play we incorporated is in finding her original inspiration for the business. She rotated to the marketing department and wrote a few blog posts for her company. That made her happier and attracted new employees to come work for her.

The second type of play was in relationships with her co-founder. They tried taking their meetings outside, without electronics, over dinner, etc. It turned a strenuous relationship into a deep friendship.  The result:  her co-founder turned into a better COO than the CEO could’ve ever could’ve imagined.

Play isn’t slacking off. It’s actually a productivity hack. When you are great at [restoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUU3WVCsXKBLx0IUZoz9K939khuDV5VUD7grBgJ5Wis/edit) with play, you will be more creative.

Rather than *giving* you line-by-line instruction on how to play (which rarely works since everyone’s definitions of “play” are vastly different), the better thing I can do is *teach*
 you how to play.

Coaches can teach you to play with the guidelines and find out what resonates with you. You play with fear to find your truth. You learn to experiment and learn instead of taking things personally. You find your personal [Zone of Genius](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UVWJox31Ani8Cq6Ymhm6DiVUiv5vPkOQd8ZdGpYmbs/edit#) and delegate the rest of your responsibilities. You play in personal lives and relationships so you feel fuller; therefore, you have more to give to their business. 

Life starts again when you discover play. You look at the world with childlike excitement and joy, but this time, powered up by your adult wisdom and resources. 

If you are intentional, you will begin to find outlets in your life that spark pure, unadulterated curiosity and playtime. That will lead to a more joyous life. And that joyous life will lead you to show up fully for your team and your company.

**Here are a few ways you can incorporate more play:**

1. Block out 1 hour per week doing something that’s fun for you. Before this time, sit down and journal for 10 minutes on what would be fun for you that day. Then, commit to not being sidetracked by other people or electronics during this time.
2. At your next team meeting, ask your team how can work be more fun? Collect their answers and keep each person accountable for 1 action item.
3. Pick 1 important person in your life (spouse, parent, friend, etc.) and ask each of you to write down what the funnest day could be for the two of you. Then, block out your calendar and make it happen.

Just like any habit, play takes repetition to be more powerful. Make time and space for regular play in your life. If you have an EA or Chief of Staff, cause them to check in with you on when you are making time for play, and what play looks like for you. Remember that play is beneficial to the company, so this can fall within their areas of responsibility (AORs). They may even be able to help you block out time in your calendar to experience this. Either way, empower those around you to hold you accountable for living a fulfilling, playful life."

Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)
Think about the people you like. Do you like people who talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
If you want to create a meaningful relationship with someone:
Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home.
Ask them lots of questions.
Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you.
When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. They will find it heartwarming to see someone who cares enough about the details of their life to remember them. 
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always enjoy that they took the time to meet.
Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""I would like to develop a real relationship with you."" That intent alone is heartwarming. And will make the person want to invest the time to create that relationship with you.
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the person is likely to say yes. If you have genuinely allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be extensive, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
If you aren't good at reading body language, wait. At some point, the person will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to work with you. Now tell me what your company does."" 
To summarize, the four keys are:
Ask them about their lives.
Prove that you heard them by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""
Let them know what you appreciate about them.
If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond, and you then have a willing partner (i.e., investor, customer, recruit) in whatever your endeavor is.
When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a substantial adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the technique, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective partners and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.
Strengthening the Relationship
Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This connection is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not every one of these rounds needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:
Matt,
Your old house, no??
Peter
http://www.sfgate.com/realestate/walkthrough/article/Soothing-style-welcoming-pool-patio-defines-11023844.php#photo-12599447
I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him. 
Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me. 
Below is another example, a message of appreciation from Bill Trenchard of First Round Capital. 
Hey Matt,
Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!

Bill
I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:
At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as ""the handwritten note guy.""
So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. (Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his iconic blogpost, states that he does this every Friday for one hour. Andy Bromberg does it for a few minutes each day.) You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. "
"Trust, Deep (2 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IB7YDr_trYKavL_RdWTb8ddJt77eqDH_6H5BsK416FM/edit# ,"Trust, Deep (2 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about building trust (5 min)
In a group ...
I coach many of the CEOs of the fastest-growing tech companies in the Bay Area. I host a monthly gathering of these CEOs, where they can share their challenges and get both tactical advice and emotional support. These CEOs have access to many other CEO groups because their investors are all in the top tier, and every top tier investor hosts such groups. But they tell me that they choose to attend my group over the others because my group is the one in which they trust the other participants most. Why?
In every group that I convene, each member must share something deeply shameful about themselves. When I first announce this, there is nervous silence. So, I go first. I share something quite horrific. And then I ask each person, ""Do you feel more or less connected to me? If so, why?"" Without exception, they all say ""More"" and then something like, ""Because I appreciate that you were willing to reveal yourself to me that way. What you did/thought/said is very human. I think in the same circumstances, I likely would have done the same thing.""
(Fear tells us never to reveal anything shameful. It tells us that if we do, people will be disgusted by us and never want to associate with us again. But my reveal proves otherwise.)
Then, I ask each person to share something equally painful. They do. But only because I have gone first and proved that revealing something truly vulnerable creates connection rather than destroying it. 
An example of something that I am ashamed of:
I preach that Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min), that you should never act in anger. And yet, I act in anger regularly. Several years ago, when I was coaching little league baseball, a parent was very competitive and wanted me to run many more practices. Still, he refused to participate (while nearly every other parent pitched in). After the season was over, he called me to tell me that I should never have volunteered to be a coach because if I hadn't, then his son would have landed on a team with a coach that was actually committed. Rather than listen and learn, I asked him, ""Where are you right now? I want to know so that I can tell you to your face what a f*(&ing asshole you are."" The only thing this accomplished was to create a rift in the town's society. From then on, people had to decide whether they would hang out with him or me. 
When listening to such a story, the key is to listen and appreciate only. The person revealing is not asking you to help them solve a problem. Instead, they are showing what they believe to be a character flaw. They want to know if you still accept them as they are. If you try to help them problem-solve, then you are saying, ""This character flaw is not acceptable. You must fix it for me to accept you."" If, on the other hand, you say ""Tell me more"" or ""Thank you for sharing that with me. I feel closer to you now."" then they will feel accepted as they are.
If you are willing to try this out, each member will likely feel deep trust toward all the others by the end of the first meeting. After that, sharing challenges from work and personal life is easy. 
1-1 …
The method works equally well 1-1. 
Peter Fenton is universally considered to be the best relationship-builder in the tech investing world. How does he do it?
One, he truly cares about people. But that isn't so unique. There are plenty of people who genuinely care, and they are great relationship-builders. 
So what makes Peter the best?
I posit that it is because he openly shares how flawed he is as a human being. When I first met Peter, within 5 minutes, he had told me things that felt like his deepest, darkest secrets. My instant thought was, ""I love this guy! He's not telling me how great he is. Instead, he's telling me how broken he is. He's so humble."" 
I then talked to other people that knew Peter, and each had had a similar experience when they met him. He shared his flaws with them…and they loved him for it!
Peter does not do this as a technique. He is very open about his flaws. And the world has rewarded him for it.

Fundraising- The Relationship Method (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/163t4I3CzQ-CUScBYp6fCxpboSgHxCB7syd4Jtzw7nco/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Fundraising: The Relationship Method (8 min)
Introductions
The introduction is a vital part of the fundraising process, and you only get one chance at it. I recommend using the Triangulation Method.
When you want to be introduced to an investor, first find three to five people in your network who know that person. Then ask each to send an email to the target investor, letting her know how great they think you are, and highly recommending that she meet with you. After receiving several such emails, the investor will proactively reach out to you. She has received recommendations before, but never three or more for the same person. She concludes that you and your company must be truly great, so she is already inclined to invest in you before she even meets you.
From your side, stack all of the referrals in a short period (within a week). You are trying to achieve critical mass and have your referrals rise above the noise of other referrals. 
It's important not to hand each referrer the same potential text to send onward. If they end up sending the same language, then the referrals are revealed to be orchestrated by you. Therefore, either give your referrers different suggested language or no suggestion at all.
Two Methods
There are two ways to raise money: the Traditional Method and the Relationship Method.
The Traditional Method is when you pitch an investment firm with your story, most often with a slide deck, describing the customer problem, solution, market size, unit economics, financial projections, competition, team members, traction, go-to-market strategy, and so on. You might run through your presentation dozens of times before you find a spark of interest in either you or your company.
The Relationship Method is to build a trusting, friendly relationship with an investor before discussing what your company does. This process takes more time, but it dramatically increases the close rate. This strategy works because we are most often guided by our emotional responses no matter how rational we appear. We make instinctive, gut choices, and our rational brains do an excellent job of retrofitting logic over those choices.
The first time you talk about your company, the investor will decide whether or not she wants to invest. If she does not yet like or trust you, then your company had better be optically perfect—and more often than not, it isn't. So, the key is to wait to talk about your company until you are sure that the investor likes and trusts you personally. By then, the investor will have a positive bias toward you and will be inclined to invest in your company, warts and all. 

But how do you get the investor to like and trust you?
Build trust and like
Think about the people you like. Do you want people who just talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
When meeting potential investors for the first time, ask them about themselves. Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home. Ask them lots of questions. Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you. When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. It is heartwarming when we find someone who cares enough about the details of our lives to remember them.
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always appreciate that they took the time to meet with you.
But how do you get a meeting in the first place without the explicit purpose of talking about your company? You can use the Triangulation Method outlined above, but if you don't have enough mutual acquaintances, you can simply ask for it. Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""We only want to work with investors with whom we have a good relationship. So let's start with a coffee to get to know each other personally."" 
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the investor is likely to say yes. If you have truly allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be long, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
You can then talk about your company with the confidence that they are already inclined to invest. If you aren't good at reading body language, just wait. At some point, they will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to invest in you. Now tell me what your company does.""

Prove that you heard by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""

Sell Yourself, Not Your Company
Cliff Weitzman, CEO of Speechify, realized that it was key to sell himself and not his company. If he could do so, he would gain investors for life—investors who would follow him through every pivot and company. So, when Cliff realized that he had established trust and like, he shared the story of his life—using a method that his brother Tyler had discovered.
Tyler Weitzman, CEO of BlackSMS, is a unique guy. He likes to research social situations. As an undergrad at Stanford, he explored a method for conveying one's achievements (or bragging, if you prefer!) while remaining humble and relatable. Through countless interviews of master storytellers, Tyler determined the ultimate structure for humbly telling one's story:
- Credit: ""It could not have happened without [name the others involved].""
- Hard Work: ""We had to put in so much to make it happen, for example, [describe the hard work].""
- Vulnerability: ""It was most difficult for me when….""
- Duty: ""Our dream drove us to [noble motive].""
- Gratitude: ""I am so proud and thankful that….""
I encourage you to tell your story to a friend using this exact structure. See what comes out. Ask your friend for her reaction. I think you will be amazed.
Here is an example of this method:
Acknowledgment
This book could not have happened without all the people that I have coached, and who coach me, including Chris Barber, Misha Talavera, Karissa Paddie, Ryan Breslow, Alex MacCaw, Naval Ravikant, Brian Armstrong, Tatiana Dorow, Alexander Kasser, and Stephen Mochary. 
We each had to put in so much to make this book happen. Chris Barber ""found"" me and invited me to coach his roommates at Stanford, which launched my coaching career. Misha,  Ryan and Alex, whom I coached, forced me to get these writings into the world. Naval read the draft and said it was the best business book he'd seen (whether true or not, that's what he told me), further encouraging me to get it out into the world. My wife, Tatiana Dorow, well, she just makes my life great by making me laugh each and every day. Alexander Kasser, my grandfather, made me feel that I could never fail, no matter how hard I swung the bat. And Stephen Mochary, my dad, has always been my best friend and biggest fan.
Writing this book was most difficult for me when it was almost done. I very much enjoyed writing the content. But the final stages of editing and formatting felt like ""work."" Luckily, Alex pushed me through those tasks.
As a group, what drove us was our dream of sharing this information with the world so that CEOs and companies could be more efficient and effective. 
I am so proud and thankful that I got a chance to work with this amazing group of people. My wish for you is that you, too, get the chance to experience the joy of coaching others one day. It is the most deeply satisfying activity that I have yet found in life. (If you know of anything more satisfying, please let me know!)

Mistakes happen. We all make them. But how do we make things right once we realize that we've made a mistake?
Three steps. Repair, Rewind, Redo.
Repair
The first thing to do is acknowledge: 
what I did
the damage that it caused
that I did not intend to cause that damage
make a commitment that I will not do that action again. 
""From now on in that situation, I will …""


Rewind
""Now, I'd like to go back in time and do it the way I plan on doing it from now on.”


Redo
Redo the statement or the action in the new way.


This process allows others to see that you recognize the damage you did, that you did not intend to cause that damage, and that you are able and willing to do it in a non-damaging way.

(I learned this exercise from Diana Chapman of the Conscious Leadership Group.)
It is essential to maximize your energy. You perform best when you are doing things that energize you. There is excellent brain science around this from Robert Sapolsky of Stanford. His work is so good that I recommend you access it directly by reading Behave or listening to his explanation in this video (1h13m).
Your goal should be to spend most of your time (75-80%) doing things that energize you. If you do, magic will occur.
Get two highlighters, pens, or pencils of different colors (red and green are ideal, but any will do). Print out the last two weeks of your calendar (from the past, not the future) when you were working, and that is representative of your everyday experience (i.e., if you did something unusual in the last two weeks like go on a big trip, then pick the two weeks prior). Add in activities you did in between meetings, before work, and after work. If you don't have a printer, do this.
Go through each workday hour-by-hour and ask yourself, ""Did that activity give me energy or drain my energy?"" Highlight those that gave you energy in green and red those that did not provide you with energy. There are no neutrals; every hour must be marked one color or the other. If an hour does not give you energy, it is red. (If you want to take a shortcut, you can just mark the reds.)
When finished, write out a list of each of the reds. 
Then group those activities into similar buckets. (i.e., 1-1 meetings, recruiting meetings, etc.)
For each type of activity that does not raise your energy, write down ways to:
Outsource it,
Eliminate it, or
Make it exquisite (i.e., meetings that you believe you must attend).
Turn each of these into actions with due dates and put them in your Task Manager.
Keep doing this Energy Audit each month until you're spending 75% or more doing things that give you energy. If you do, you will achieve far more in less time because you will perform far better. You will be in your Zone of Genius.
There are some common actions that don't give people energy. To these, you need to say ""no!"" Here are some ways to do that: No - how to say it


Zone of Genius
What is the Zone of Genius? Well, there are four zones.
Zone of Incompetence.
Zone of Competence.
Zone of Excellence.
Zone of Genius.
Zone of Incompetence is what other people probably do better than you (i.e., fix your car), and therefore you should outsource if they don't give you joy.
Zone of Competence is what you do just fine, but others are as good as you (i.e., clean your bathroom), and therefore you should outsource if they don't give you joy.
Zone of Excellence is what you are excellent at (i.e., better than others) but don't love doing. This area is the danger zone. Many people will want you to keep doing these things (as they gain significant value from you doing them), but this is the area that you should also look to move away from. This is the hard one!
Zone of Genius is the things you are uniquely good at in the world and that you love to do (so much that time and space likely disappear when you do them). This zone is where you can add the most value to the world and yourself. This area is where you should be driving toward spending most, if not all, of your time.
Some people worry that if each of us operates solely in our Zone of Genius, no one will be available to do the un-fun stuff. This is a false fear. There are many personality types. For every activity that feels un-fun to you, there is someone out there who not only excels at it but loves it. (Yes, even the ""horrible"" tasks, like firing people.) The key in any organization is for people to be transparent about what their Zone of Genius is and then map all activities to the right people (through an AORs list).

Many of the CEOs that I coach have become big fans of this Energy Audit. Mathilde Collin of Front is such a fan that she wrote up her own post about it. You will notice very similar content. The difference is her personal examples.

What is the Zone of Genius?  Well, there are four zones.


Zone of Incompetence.
Zone of Competence.
Zone of Excellence.
Zone of Genius.

Zone of Incompetence are the things that other people probably do better than you (ie- fix your car), and therefore you should outsource if they don’t give you joy.

Zone of Competence are the things that you do just fine, but others are as good as you (ie- clean your bathroom) and therefore you should outsource if they don’t give you joy.

Zone of Excellence are the things that you are excellent at (ie- better than others), but don’t love doing.  This is the danger zone.  Many people will want you to keep doing these things (as they gain significant value from you doing them, ie- key functions in your job), but this is the area that you should also look to move away from.  This is the hard one!

Zone of Genius are the things that you are uniquely good at in the world, and that you love to do (so much so that time and space likely disappear when you do them).  This is where you can add most value to the world and yourself.  This is where you should be driving toward spending most, if not all, of your time.

Some people worry that if each of us operates solely in our Zone of Genius that no one will be available to do the un-fun stuff.  This is a false fear.  There are many personality types.  For every activity that feels un-fun to you, there is someone out there who not only excels at it, but loves it. (Yes, even the “horrible” tasks, like firing people.)  The key in any organization is for people to be transparent about what their Zone of Genius is, and then map all activities to the right people (through an AORs list).

Now that you know what a Zone of Genius is, how do you identify yours?  Oddly, because time and space likely disappear when you are in your ZoG, you are probably not even aware of what you do that is uniquely amazing.  To discover it, you likely have to crowdsource other people’s experience of you.  Because others who interact with you can usually see it quite clearly.

To do this, identify a group of people who interact with you regularly.  Send them each a message:

“I am trying to understand the things that I am uniquely good at in the world.  It is difficult for me to see them myself.  But I am hoping that you can help me identify them.  Would you be willing to take 10 minutes to answer the following questions? If yes, thank you.  If not, no problem at all.  I understand that this is an imposition on my part.

In your interactions with me:
What do I do that you experience as “world-class”?  
What do I do where I appear to be experiencing fun, peace or joy (if different from above)?
What do I do that I am good at but that I don’t appear to enjoy?
What do I do that I am not better than others?

Most CEOs that I coach, when I first meet them, are working 14 hour days. If they have a spouse and children, they then spend another few hours connecting with them. The rest of the time, they sleep but never enough. 
The obvious cost of this lifestyle is that it leaves little if any time for the brain to turn off and restore. 
The unobvious cost is that the brain is not fully creative (or creative at all) when it has no time to be distraction-free.
All CEOs need mental rest. And all of them need to be creative to envision (and document) the future of their product or service.
So, how do you get mental rest and become creative while also working 14 hours a day?
The answer is: find ways to get bored. Small ways and big ways. 
Let me explain.
We are naturally in a mentally restorative and creative state until we introduce distractions. And modern life is nothing but distractions, both work and pleasure. On the work side: responding to messages, being in meetings, etc. On the pleasure side: watching videos or social media posts. All give us small hits of adrenaline, which temporarily feel good.  But they also put our brains in alert status (amygdala) to see what comes next, with no capacity for creative thought. And the constant adrenaline doesn't allow our minds to rest and restore. 
When we remove these distractions, we at first feel bored (for some people this feeling is almost unbearable).  But if we allow ourselves to sit with this state and simply let it be, then eventually we start to feel a sense of mental relaxation.  And then our creative thoughts begin to flow.
To achieve this state, we truly need to experience NO DISTRACTIONS. That means turning off all sources of distraction. Certainly all electronic sources (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.). As well as all inbound requests for information: email, text, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.
You can do this for a few minutes (whenever you use the restroom), 30-60 minutes (when you have a meal), two days (the weekend), or a week (a restorative vacation or staycation).
All of these have value. The key to each is allowing yourself to get bored. And in the beginning, you won't enjoy it. You are physically addicted to distraction and the adrenaline that it delivers. Give yourself time to get unaddicted. On the other side, you will find restoration and creativity. 
Start with something small. Simply delete your social media apps, and commit to putting your phone away (in another room) whenever you are using the restroom, eating, or drinking. During that time, simply sit with your thoughts. Take your food and beverages outside if you can (to eliminate further the distraction of seeing your workspace). Stare at the leaves swaying in the wind while you eat and drink. 
Try this for 30 days. It is a low-cost experiment, as you aren't getting real work done when eating, drinking, and using the restroom anyway. See if you feel more or less restored and creative than you did in the previous 30 days.
If you feel more so, then step up your experimentation and try longer stints distraction-free. Try an entire weekend disconnected. If that feels good (and it will!), then schedule an entire week disconnected. And if that feels good, then make all of this a regular practice. Put it on your calendar.
All meals entirely disconnected.
One weekend a month entirely disconnected. 
One week a quarter entirely disconnected.
That investment alone will reap huge rewards for your mental peace and the company's ability to see the future.

This works for artistic creativity as well. I once coached a well-known musician. He came to me because he needed to write the songs for his new album, but no creativity would flow. He would go into the studio each afternoon after a day of meetings and responding to emails. He couldn't quiet his mind from the day's activities, so he started taking a few stiff drinks. This action calmed his mind a bit, but not enough. And the drinks were starting to take a toll on his body. What to do?
The answer: we simply applied the philosophy above. We arranged for him to rent a studio in another part of the country (where no one would know where to find him) for ten days, turn off all messaging and entertainment apps, have with him only the key people he needed to function (i.e., to get food and drink, collaborate on the music production, etc.), no drugs or alcohol, and allow himself to simply get bored. 
He called me after the ten days and said: ""Matt, it was incredible. I was more creative than I've ever been. I wrote and recorded the best songs of my life, and I know this album will be a huge hit. I cannot thank you enough. In hindsight, it makes so much sense. Every artist should be doing this.""
The album has now been released.  It is indeed a hit.


Matteo Franceschetti, CEO of EightSleep: 
 
“This is a game-changer.  I call it Stillness.  I just sit doing nothing and let my monkey mind go everywhere.  At the beginning the monkey is crazy.  Then the monkey starts slowing down, and clarity comes.  When I am on vacation, I make sure to do Stillness at least 1 hour per day.  Stillness is the vacation.  And now I am forcing myself to do at least 10 minutes per day when I am working.  In the first minutes, I keep moving my arm to grab my phone.  But eventually my mind stills, and I feel peace.  It is a game-changer.”

When doing the Energy Audit, here are some of the most common things that CEOs do that don't give them energy:
Informational meetings
Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)
1-1s with former reports
Difficult conversations
1-1s that are not functional
Group meetings that are not functional
And here are some strategies to deal with them …

Informational meetings. 
Now that your company is succeeding, people want to talk to you. They ask to get a coffee together. If you don’t know the person asking, you have no obligation to respond.  But some of these people may be old friends, friends of friends, or significant people in the community. You don't get energy from spending an hour with them, but you also don't want to give them the cold shoulder and gain a reputation for being aloof.
Well, there is a solution. 
First, decide how much time you are willing to spend on the person.  
If it is 5 minutes or less, then …
Just as most 350-page business books only contain about three pages of real information, just so most times people want to get coffee for an hour, it is simply to ask for one favor, which takes 1 minute to ask, and likely two minutes to do. 
When someone emails me to get a coffee, I immediately call them. I know that they are free as they have just emailed me. They usually pick up. They are so honored that I called them quickly. I then let them know that I have just a few minutes, but I'd like to be helpful. They ask me the favor. (It is usually a request for an introduction.) I usually oblige, which takes me about two minutes. Done. The person feels honored that I responded so quickly and did what they were hoping for, and it took me less than five minutes total.
If I get the email long after they sent it, and they don't pick up when I call back, then I respond in an email: ""Scheduling a coffee will take a while, but I can call you fairly soon. You are now on my call list, and I will call you when I can."" I then put them on my call list and call whenever I would otherwise be listening to a podcast (i.e., in an Uber). This call usually occurs within 24-48 hours of their request. Again, they are honored by the speedy connection. And once again, the call need only last a few minutes.
If it is 1 minute or less, then …
I respond with a written email or text response.  Each time I encounter a new situation and therefore write a new response, I save it.  At this point, the vast majority of the time, I simply copy-paste a response that I have already written previously.  Here is an example:
“Thank you for your request to ….  While I am sure that I would enjoy that, I am choosing to focus my time on my top priorities, which are ____, ___, and ____.  And therefore I cannot accommodate your request.”
“While I cannot meet for coffee, I would like to help if I can.  What question do you have for me?  If I am able to help in a reasonable amount of, I will.”
If it is 30 seconds or less, then …
Get a CoS or virtual EA, and forward them each such request for the CoS/EA to create a draft message for you to send.   You then hit the Send button.

Podcasts
I am so honored by this request.  Thank you for thinking of me.  

That being said, I unfortunately don’t have space in my schedule to do it.   

I am focusing all of my podcast time on setting up and conducting the Mochary CEO Masterminds.   These give all Mochary Method CEOs access to the “behind the scenes” info that each of us can only get when the recording devices are turned off.

I love that you are doing your podcast.  It does and will create tremendous value.  I am cheering you on from the sideline!

While I can’t do your podcast, there is another Mochary Method coach who can.  Would you be open to having one of them on?  

Each of them has done at least one (and some several) excellent podcasts.  They are stars.  




Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)
Often a CEO likes to interview all candidates that are one level below her reports. And Recruiting wants to show at least 3-4 qualified candidates for each open position, which is more to prove that Recruiting is performing than it is about getting better candidates. Offer rates therefore are, by definition, around 25% or less. This strategy leads to many onsite interviews of candidates who never get hired—a tremendous cost. Don't pay it.
Instead, go with the policy of only bringing in an A player for an onsite interview (i.e., only candidates that absolutely blew you away in the first phone screen), and then be willing to hire that person without seeing any other candidates. If you do this, you will be able to move much faster. The best candidates can only be closed if you move very fast because they want to feel that you fell in love with them from the first moment that you met them. (Btw, someone else is moving very fast with them, so if you don't, you will lose them.) If you do this, your acceptance rate on the best candidates will go way up. And you will spend far less time interviewing, leaving far more time for onboarding your phenomenal hires and building the company.
Have your first phone screen scheduled for 15 minutes
In addition, once you make your initial phone screen very strict and only bring A players for onsite interview day, then do what Palantir does: They split the interview day into two halves and inform the candidate of this. They only pass to the second half of the day if the first half went well. At lunch, the team reads the morning interviewers' assessments. If they are positive, the candidate moves to the afternoon to meet the more senior interviewers. If the morning didn't go well enough, the interview day ends at lunch, thus saving a lot of time for the senior exec.
Some CEOs and Department Heads feel that they need to be the bar raiser. And the bar-raising function is indeed essential. But you don't have to be that person. You can train that person. The way to do that is:
They watch you do 2-3 interviews and see your conclusion.
You watch them do 1-2 interviews, and you give them feedback on their conclusion. Once you feel satisfied that the person will act as you do, then …
They take your place as a bar-raiser and teach someone else using the method above. 

1-1s with former reports
Many CEOs create deep relationships with their reports. As the company grows and they need to layer those reports, the layered person wants to maintain a connection with the CEO and asks to continue their 1-1s. The CEO often agrees. But later, these 1-1 with non-direct reports become burdensome as the opportunity cost of that time becomes higher and higher. 
Share this transparently with the non-direct reports. They are owners of the company too. They want to maximize their equity value. Once they realize that their 1-1s with you are taking you away from running the business, they will no longer want the 1-1s.

Difficult conversations
Many people fear difficult conversations. This emotion is understandable. We were never trained in school to have these conversations. We don't know how to make them go well. Read Feedback and practice (role-play) with a partner until you're able to stick to the script. Then try it on the next difficult conversation. You might end up loving difficult conversations!

1-1s that are not functional
They are your direct reports. You know that you need to have 1-1s with them. But the meetings are draining. What would make it exquisite for you? Write down all the criteria, and then share those criteria with your report at the next 1-1. Ask if they are open to having such a 1-1 going forward. They will say ""yes!""
If you're unsure what a fantastic 1-1 would look like, experiment with this 1-1 Template and Instructions.

Group meetings that are not functional
As the group leader, you have to hold group meetings to keep your team informed, decide on cross-functional issues, and facilitate feedback (peer-to-peer and to you). But that doesn't mean that you need to run the meeting. Pick your most process-oriented team member (or hire a Chief of Staff). Have them be the Meeting Lead. You are still the decision-maker, but they set the agenda, ensure that all attendees get their pre-work submitted before the meeting, keep the time-boxing during the meeting, ensure that issues drive to decisions and then to specific actions with DRIs and due dates, which all get recorded in your Agreements Tracker. If you and they aren't sure what a good meeting looks like, follow the guidance in Meetings.

Meetings:  How to make them effective and efficient (4 min) Video,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4tP-ZtTg2OkHgu8dih4qzNSXtp9zrwS5o_Blrs6_Sk/edit ,"Meetings:  How to make them effective and efficient (4 min)

Video of Matt explaining how to make meetings effective and efficient (5 min)

Meetings are a necessary evil. But only a tiny part of meetings are essential (ie- need to be done synchronously). The rest actually is evil (ie- can be done asynchronously).
IMHO, there are steps to making all meetings effective and efficient:
Assign a Meeting Owner to every meeting
Determine the Desired Outcome for every meeting
Determine what Asynchronous Preparation can be done
Enforce that this asynchronous work is completed. 
Time-box the synchronous agenda.
Drive to Actions. And write down all Actions with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and due date.
Track all actions in an action-tracker.
Collect written Feedback on the meeting itself.
Meeting Owner
Without a Meeting Owner, there will be a tragedy of the commons. Unless one person is responsible for making them happen, all of the other necessary ingredients of a successful meeting will not occur, as no one will feel authorized to grab the ball.
Here is a cheat sheet for the Meeting Owner: Meeting guidance sheet (1 min)
Desired Outcome
What is the actual purpose of this meeting? This should be clearly stated and written down. At the end of each meeting, each participant should state (in writing) whether the purpose was achieved. 
Most meetings don't declare a purpose, and therefore become arenas for people to hear themselves talk. I call those … Board Meetings.
Asynchronous Preparation
Much of a meeting can be done asynchronously. Any status update, declaration of an issue to be solved, pipeline to be reviewed … can all be written and shared in advance, allowing others to read and comment on them even before the meeting begins.
Enforcement
While it is true that much of the meeting prep can be done asynchronously, that doesn't mean that everyone will do it. This is where the Meeting Owner creates value: enforcement. My preferred process is to show people how to do things in a group setting before asking them to do it on their own in advance. Here's what I mean …

Meeting 1:                  (usually 2 hours)
Prior to meeting 
Nothing


During meeting 
First 15 minutes,  I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
Meeting 2:                  (usually 1.5 hours)
Prior to meeting 
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting. 
For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write. 


Pre-meeting 
I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.


During meeting 
First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
Meeting 3:                  (usually 50 minutes or less)
Prior to meeting 
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them 24 hours before the meeting.
I ask all to pre-read and pre-comment on each other's updates.


During meeting 
We begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
If there is someone in the group who has difficulty pre-writing 24 hours before the meeting, I don't shame them. Instead, we move back to Meeting 2 format. This stage is where most teams end up.
Time-box
Certain things must be done synchronously. 
Personal connection. 
If a team is fully remote, then informal chat about personal lives rarely happens. I like to build in 5 minutes of this in a hyper-efficient way by asking each participant to take 30 seconds to share a highlight from their personal lives. 
Without this step or something like it, teams will lose personal connection and trust over time.

Trust: How to create it among peers (2 min)
Issue. 
When someone presents an Issue, I want to hear them describe it verbally so that I can know what emotion they are experiencing (fear, anger, joy, excitement, etc.), as I am likely to trust their Proposed Solution much more if they are experiencing the positive emotions that lead to brain activity in the pre-frontal cortex. 
Further reading 
Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min)


As Decision-Maker, I want to ask questions of those who made comments that didn't agree 100% with the Proposed Solution. (This ensures that all commenters feel heard.)


Critical feedback. 
While we give it as a gift, it is not always received that way. I want to know how it is received in real-time so that if the recipient gets triggered I can jump in and declare that I did not intend to anger them. 
So, we do these things synchronously, but we don't let them last forever. Instead, we time-box each item. 
For Issues, I give them 5-20 minutes of verbal discussion depending on their importance. If a clear-cut decision cannot be made in that time, I ask the Decision-Maker to declare what further information they need, assign people to get that information, and then declare a new date/time when we can digest it and make a decision made.
For Critical Feedback, I usually give five minutes per presenter. If we are doing paired feedback, I give that ten minutes. If we are doing hot seat feedback (everyone providing feedback to one person), I give that five minutes per presenter. For this reason, I prefer Paired Feedback as we can get feedback to everyone in the room (even if there are 20 people) in just 10 minutes.
Write down all Actions
This step is where most meetings fail. People are so relieved to have gotten to a decision on Issues that they fail to take the final step of writing down every Action, assigning each action to one person (people can work collaboratively, but there must be one person who reports whether the Action got done or not) and a due date. Make sure your Meeting Owner completes this final step. It is the difference-maker.
Tracker
Once actions get written down, track them (in ClickUp, Monday, Asana, a Google Sheet, or Notion). Then in future meetings, check this tracker. This step will remind everyone of their Actions and give all the confidence that they are being done.
If you don't have an Action-Tracker and question the need for one, please read Agreement-Tracker: why you need one (3 min).
Feedback
Every meeting I have, whether 1-1, Team or Board, I always ask for written feedback. It usually takes 2-3 minutes to give. I make it the very last agenda item so that people can leave as soon as they finish writing. 
Giving this feedback makes people feel heard, which gets them to fully participate in future meetings. It also gives me valuable advice on how to make the meeting better.
If I don't ask for feedback, people don't give it. They still have thoughts about improving the meeting, but they withhold those thoughts and then build up resentment toward me. Asking for feedback instantly bleeds off that resentment.

The pushback that I get on asynchronous prep is: ""This takes a long time to do. Isn't this just making the meeting longer?"" 
My answer is: 
""No. While the prep does take a while, the other participants' ability to ingest the material goes up by 5x, making the synchronous meeting itself that much shorter and the quality of the outcome that much greater. Written prep also ensures that everyone has a voice, not just those who are bold. This awareness creates buy-in and boosts morale significantly.
If async prep is too hard to enforce, stick with a Meeting 1 format, where people write and read in real-time during the meeting. That is far more effective than verbal only.""
