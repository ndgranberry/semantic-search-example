7 Calendar Tips for Startups,https://www.startuphacks.vc/blog/2014/03/31/7-calendar-tips-for-startups,"7 Calendar Tips for Startups
March 30, 2014
Written By Alex Iskold
screen-shot-2014-03-31-at-12-22-13-am1.png
I once had the pleasure of hearing Lou Gerstner, former CEO of IBM, speak. Something he said stuck in my head: ""Never let anyone own your schedule."" It's simple, it's obvious, yet it's genius.Over the years, whenever I didn't follow this advice, I was stressed and unproductive. Gradually, I learned that planning and following a routine makes a huge difference in how I feel and what I get done. Here are some of the things that help me manage my schedule that you may find helpful:

1. Create a routine
No matter what you are working on, create a routine. Block times for specific activities, and stick with the plan. Turn your calendar into a bunch of blocks, and put activities into those blocks. Whatever is not planned, you don't do. If you want free time / exercise time / reading TechCrunch time, plan it all.Your routine may change throughout the year, but at any given time it's better to have a plan. For example, if you are working on launching a company, and need to do customer discovery, coding, and hiring, then prioritize and block specific times for each activity.Here is a sample calendar I made that illustrates some of the concepts and ideas from this post.Sample Calendar

2. Group meetings and calls into blocks
Group meetings and calls into time blocks. For example, if you need to have outside meetings, block two 1/2 days a week for those meetings, and go to the outside meetings only during those times. Do the same thing for in-office meetings. This way you are not only creating a chunk of time for meetings, you are also creating other blocks of time that you will be able to focus on important P1 work. Do the same thing with calls – book them all back-to-back.

3. Optimize time for different meeting types
Personally I am now a big fan of 30-minute meetings, and 10-minute calls. I think 10-minute calls are great way to initially connect with someone or give someone quick advice. You can do a Google Hangout or Skype if you prefer to see the person instead of just hearing them. The reason 10-minute calls work is because people skip the B.S. and get to the point. Try it – 10 minutes is actually a lot of time, if you focus. I prefer to do these calls on Fridays, when I am usually working from home.I am not a big fan of introductory coffee meetings, lunches, and dinners. I am a huge fan of coffee and meals with people I already know. Those meetings are typically productive and fun, but the first time you are meeting someone, it's more productive to do a call, or an actual 30-minute meeting in the office.Here are the types of meetings you might want to book:

30-min meeting in the office to get to know someone or catch up
45-min meeting outside of the office, allow 15-min travel time
10-min call to help someone who needs advice
15-min daily standup - great for startups / engineering teams
30-min weekly staff meeting
Whatever meetings you do, group them into blocks depending on your particular schedule. If you feel like a particular type of meeting needs more or less time, then adjust the block accordingly.

4. Use Appointment Slots
There is a great feature in Google Calendar called Appointment Slots. It allows you to book a chunk of time, and then split it into pieces. For example, I can book 3 hours of outside meetings and then split it into 3 meetings - 1 hour each. Or I can book 1 hour of calls and split it into 6 calls, 10 minutes each. There is also a bunch of specific tools, like doodle, that do that too.The next step is to create bit.ly links for different blocks of time. You can have a link for your outside meetings, another link for 30-minute inside meetings and yet another one for 10-minute calls. You then share these links with people, and they can book the time with you. I've done this with Techstars candidate companies and it was amazingly effective. It minimized the back-and-forth on the email and saved a ton of time for me and the companies.This won't work with everyone, because some people may find this rude. I personally don't find it rude at all when someone sends me their availability. In any case, if you are not comfortable sending the link to someone, then you can use your own Appointment Slots, suggest a few meeting times, and then book the specific slot yourself.Btw, if you are asking someone to meet, always propose several specific alternative times such as Tuesday at 4:30 pm, or 5:00 pm, or Wednesday at 11:00 am, or Friday at 4:30 pm.David Tisch gave a great talk that covers scheduling meetings and many more basics of communication.

5. Block time for email
This is the most important tip in the whole post. Email will own you unless you own it. To own your email you must avoid doing it all the time. To do that, you need to schedule the time to do your email. It is absolutely a must. In fact, it is so important that I wrote a whole entire blog post just about managing your email. Go read Inbox 0.

6. Plan your exercise and family time
Unless you put it on the calendar, it won't get done. Well, that applies to your exercise and time with your family as well. Whether you go in the morning, afternoon, or evening; whether you do it 3 times a week or every day, put the exercise time on the calendar. My friend and mentor Nicole Glaros, makes it very clear that her mornings, until 10 am, belong to her. She hits the pavement or the gym, depending on the weather, and rarely deviates from her routine.I have been guilty of not having regular exercise routine because I am adjusting to my new in-program schedule, but I am jamming exercise in whenever I can, 4 times a week, and actively working on locking in my specific exercise schedule. Without regular exercise I can't be productive at running the fast-paced 13-week marathon called Techstars NYC program.Same thing goes about planning time with your family and significant others. If you are a workaholic like me, you will end up stealing time from your family, unless you book it in advance and train yourself to promptly unplug. Many people in the industry have talked about planning family time. My favorite is Brad Feld, who talks about it a lot.

7. Actually manage your time
I think about my time a lot. I think about where it goes. I think about where I can get more of it, and how to optimize it. When I was running GetGlue, I had an assistant who was managing my time. She was awesome, she really was. But when I joined Techstars, I decided that I will manage my calendar myself. I have to confess that I am super happy about this decision.I find myself thinking about what I am doing, who am I meeting with and why a lot more. I meet with a HUGE amount of people every week. My schedule is particularly insane during the selection process. Yet, because I manage my calendar, follow a routine, plan meetings in blocks and use Appointment slots, I find myself less overwhelmed and less stressed.Taking ownership of my calendar and planning my days and weeks made me a happier and more productive human. I hope this post helps you get there too.And of course, I would love to hear your productivity tips. How do you manage your time? How do you handle your calendar? What tools do you use? Please share in the comments below.

Great tips, most challenging for me is sticking to the schedule as things come up all the time. Spot on with shorter meetings/calls, so much more effective specially for non-design related topics. On email I used to have an app called Goldmine that helped me link emails to specific contact with action items so I did not lose the important info often contained in email but they moved up the chain so looking for something else. Having an empty inbox is a beautiful sight I have not seen in a while.","Tips for startups: create a routine, group meetings, optimize meeting types, use Appointment Slots, block email time, plan exercise and family time, manage time effectively."

In my coaching, I have found that many people (including me) simply hate doing specific tasks (usually admin) and therefore don't actually do them, causing debt. How to solve this?
The first answer is to delegate these tasks away as much as possible. But there always remain a few that are not delegatable. For those, which only we can do, we need a different strategy.
The question then is: How do we motivate ourselves to do them?
I have found that primarily extroverts (of which I am one) have this issue. And that is likely because we get energized by one of two things: 
Being around other humans
Doing fun things
If we have to do something that isn't fun and we're alone, it is painful. But If we're in the presence of another human, then we're usually OK to do that thing which isn't fun. Who that other human is doesn't matter too much. It can be our child, our EA, or any other random person.
If your EA is available, reach out to him each time you need to do such a task and ask him to simply be there (phone, video call, or in-person are all equally effective) to keep you company. If he is unavailable (or you don't have one), try Focusmate for admin tasks. I have used it, and it's surprisingly effective.","To overcome avoidance of specific tasks, delegate what you can and for the rest, find an accountability partner for support."
Agreement-Tracker:  why you need one (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzGvP6MrmlD6YVilTiNjEsPgRRvjzvWrqGXKSz_c68k/edit ,"Agreement-Tracker:  why you need one (3 min)

How to use Asana as an Agreement Tracker: Easy, Medium, Expert levels (by Regina Gerbeaux, CoS to Matt Mochary)
When you are in a small group (less than 20 people in one office space), you don't need a system of sharing information because everyone in the group can literally hear each other. All team members can grok the CEO's priorities. And the CEO groks the obstacles that the teammates are encountering.
But once you can no longer physically hear each other talk (i.e., when you are working remotely even if less than 20 people, or you are in person but more than 20 people), then there is no way to overhear those priorities and obstacles. Now you need to create a structured system of information flow. If you do not, team members will not work on the highest priority tasks, and the CEO will not unblock the team members. The system must be written (otherwise, the details cannot be shared with those that happened not to be present for the physical conversation), and agreements (i.e., actions that I have agreed to do) must be tracked to completion. 
People sometimes use a Google Doc or Sheet to track agreements for a particular meeting (a 1-1 or team meeting). This step has limited value because these Docs then proliferate, and each team member has tasks listed across many docs, which is impractical for them to track.
For an agreement-tracker to be effective, each person must have only one location where they need to look to see all the actions they have agreed to do. This is precisely why action-trackers like Monday.com and Asana were created. They have overhead (i.e., it takes more time to write down an action in Asana than it does to write it on an individual notepad), so it should only be used for actions where you have agreed with someone else (i.e., your manager, your teammates, etc.) that you will do that action. 
I recommend using a lower overhead tool like an individual electronic notepad for actions only on your own to-do list.
When implementing an agreement-tracker in your company, there are a few best practices to follow:
Start using it yourself first so that you are familiar with it. 
Then start using it in your 1-1s with your direct reports. It will be more overhead than using a Google Doc, but this is simply a stepping stone to the next step. Let it sit here for a few meetings until each report is using the tool correctly. 
Then start using it in your team meeting. Let it sit here for a few meetings until all see the value of it. 
This action is where it will become powerful. Now each team member will see just how much each other team member is getting done. 
This transparency will instantly boost morale. Because up until now, each member doubted that any other member was actually doing any work at all. Each person thought they were the only one doing actual work and questioned whether they should continue to be the chump. (i.e., morale was falling)
Then require your directs to start using it with their 1-1s, and eventually in their team meetings.
Continue to require that the tool get cascaded down until everyone in the company is using it.
There is one exception to this usage. Engineering departments often prefer to use a more technical action-tracker like Jira. (Although I know plenty of engineering departments that use Asana and love it.) If your engineering department prefers Jira, that is fine. Allow them to use it and not be on the rest-of-the-company system.
When I came into a company and was the 1-day-a-week CEO to implement my management system, I always implemented this action-tracking tool (usually Asana). I did it at Clearbit, Angellist, Bolt, etc. It worked magically.
Then I started coaching bigger companies. When I suggested this tool, I got push-back (usually from the older VPs on the executive team, who I think didn't want to learn a new tool). Their excuse was always similar: ""Matt, those companies you mentioned are all less than 150 people. But we're over 1,000 people. There is no way that we could impose a universal tool here."" 
I am not interested in forcing people, so I didn't. 
Until I started coaching Francis Davidson at Sonder … with 1300 employees … all on Asana. And the company operated better than any of the others that I coached with more than a few hundred employees. I finally had the example that I needed!
So, now that you are working remotely, and even when you return in person one day, use an action-tracking tool throughout the entire company. Agreed-upon actions will actually get done, everyone will be able to see that clearly, and morale will soar … creating an upward spiral of productivity. 
Note on Asana: 
If you choose to use Asana, there are several rules that you need to follow to achieve success:
Train people on how to use it before you ask them to use it for work. This training needs to be nothing more than a 15-minute session. 
Identify the most Asana-knowledgeable person in the company. 
Ask that person to write a list of all the useful Asana actions.
Schedule a team training session 
The trainer shows how to perform the first action on a screen visible to all.
All participants perform that same action on their screen.
If any participant gets stuck, they can ask their neighbor or the trainer for help.
Repeat for all the actions on the list.
Suggest that people put individual tasks (i.e., those they do not have to agree with someone else) in an individual task-manager (like Evernote, Omnifocus, Things3, etc.), not Asana. Once Asana gets populated with too many tasks, recognizing the actual priority actions becomes overwhelming and difficult. Only if someone becomes very comfortable with Asana should they attempt to use it as their sole task manager.
Never blindly assign someone a task in Asana. Only use Asana to log agreements already made (i.e., the person agreed to do the action). An easy way to ensure this: Only the action-doer is the person who writes the task in Asana. They will never write something that they didn't agree to.

There are many tools that can effectively be used as agreement trackers.  ClickUp, Monday.com, Asana, Height, Coda, Notion.  Each have their pros and cons.  I recommend that you test each before choosing one.

","Use Asana as an agreement tracker to ensure tasks are completed, boost morale, and increase productivity in remote work settings."

Building a company will take a physical and mental toll. All the work you put towards your company will be for naught if it costs you your health. It is incredibly important that you focus on both your physical and mental health, and take active measures to improve them.

Ideally take some form of exercise everyday, but at least ensure that you’re working out multiple days a week. Figure out what exercise works for you, be that lifting, running, or boxing. If you find your self-motivation is slipping, get a buddy to train with, sign up for group activities (e.g. Barry's Bootcamp), or get a trainer. If you can’t afford a trainer, get the company to pay for it. Your investors won’t mind; your physical health is paramount.

Company building takes an emotional toll too. It is important that you have someone to speak to, listen to you, and help feelings flow through you. The alternative is bottling up anger, sadness, fear until you and your company self-destruct. Build a CEO support group comprised of your peers. Learn to be vulnerable in front of the company and practice Conscious Leadership (Chapter 15). Get a therapist; even if you think you don’t need one, you will invariably find it useful.

Meditation is also a tool to help focus and quiet the mind. A good company perk is to buy a team account for a meditation app like Calm (calm.com) or Headspace (headspace.com), and then set aside a room in your office for meditating.

All Hands: Leadership and Inspiration: How to create it (6 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PTcxTzNFIh1gbBdyC8F0hRLLPh7CFt1XRCwzS0SZku8/edit ,"Leadership and Inspiration: How to create it (6 min)

Many of the CEOs I work with have asked me, ""How do I become a more inspiring leader?""
The answer has many parts.
Fundamentally, people want to feel that the company where they work is:
Solving a meaningful problem 
For real living beings 
On the path to winning
In addition, each person wants to feel that:
Her positive contributions are needed for the company to win (this is where you create a sense of urgency)
She knows what she is doing well and what she needs to do to improve
Others are pulling as just as hard as she is
And finally, that the decision-makers:
Know and care about her concerns, and make decisions accordingly
Are telling her the truth about the company's progress, challenges, etc. (the good and the bad, their raw thoughts and feelings)
Each of these requires a different action. If all are done, then people will feel inspired to work at your company. Let's look at how to achieve each.
Solving a meaningful problem 
For this, you must write out a Mission that addresses a real problem people can identify. Be bold. Don't worry about turning off 97% of the population. You only need fierce buy-in from less than 1% of the population. So, be very bold in clearly stating the specific problem that you are trying to solve.
Mission, Vision, Values:  How to create them


For real living beings 
In the Vision, identify exactly who has this problem. 
Let's look to the most successful form of inspiring humans ever invented: the Hollywood narrative film. In its most basic form, a Hollywood movie identifies a protagonist. It makes the protagonist relatable, and therefore likable. It then puts that protagonist in real danger. We then begin to cheer and root for the protagonist. You need to do the same in your Vision statement. 
Pick one real living example of your customer. (Almost always, this is a human who is deciding to pay you money.)
Describe the personal traits of this person. Make her relatable. This description is what will make us like her. 
How old is she? Where does she live, and what does she do? Is she married with kids? Does she have a pet? If yes, what are all their names? What are her hopes and fears? What gives her joy, sadness, and anger? 
Show us the problem that she has (i.e., the danger that she is facing).
Because we already like her, we are now trying hard to solve her problem and save her from this danger.


On the path to winning 
Once you have created a meaningful Mission and a Vision with a worthy protagonist, you now need to clearly show the path to winning and declare whether you are still on this path or not. 
The most meaningful and sustainable path to winning is to 
First, create a unique solution that is 10x better than the existing solutions.
Then, create a moat that makes it nigh-impossible for anyone else to supplant you.
You should describe Both of these in your Vision. 
And then, in each update to the company, you must show the progress you are making both toward the Product Vision and toward the Moat.


Her positive contributions are needed for the company to win. 
Each employee wants to feel that they are a crucial part of the company's success. The easiest way to do this is to create quarterly company OKRs (I prefer three or less) that cover every function in the company (Product, People, Profits). Then department OKRs feed into one or more of the company OKRs. Then team OKRs that clearly feed into one or more of the department OKRs. Then individual OKRs that clearly feed into one or more of the team OKRs. Thus a clear causal pathway is created from the individual's OKRs to the company's OKRs which are mission-critical for success.
In every 1-1, have each Manager point out this direct causal connection. It takes less than 1 minute to do.


She knows what she is doing well and what she needs to do to improve. 
Everyone wants to perform well. They want to know whether they are and what they can do to improve. And they want to know this near-constantly so that they can adjust, instead of once every six months during performance reviews (when it's too late for them to do anything about it).
Therefore give feedback regularly: 
Praise individuals in every team meeting. (Remember to praise those doing the critical but non-sexy jobs.)
Give critical feedback in the 1-1. (Always synchronously, i.e., in person or via phone)


Others are pulling as just as hard as she is 
No one wants to feel that they are the only ones working. And without specific knowledge that others are pulling their weight, our brain creates conspiracy theories that they are not. And then we ask ourselves, ""Why should I work so hard if others aren't?"" Then we begin to slack off, and the conspiracy theories become true.
To counter this, create absolute transparency across the company of what all other people are doing. 
The easiest way that I know of to do this is to use a tool (that everyone knows how to use) that tracks actions and/or progress toward OKRs. 
Examples include Asana, Perdoo, Jira, etc.
A current best practice that I have seen is: 
Jira for Engineering
Asana for everyone else 
I look forward to the day when this can become a single tool.


Decision-makers know and care about her concerns and make decisions accordingly. 
People want to feel heard. The easiest way that I know of to do this is for every manager to regularly (in 1-1s and team meetings) ask each of their reports: 
What issue do you see in the company, and what solution do you propose?
What issue do you see in my behavior, and what request would you like to make?
Treat the answers to these questions like the gold that they are: 
Thank your report for sharing them.
Repeat them back to prove that you actually heard the intent.
Act on them if you agree that they are valid.
If each manager is doing this, then Issues and Proposed Solutions will quickly get sucked up the chain until you make a decision.


Decision-makers are telling her the truth about the company's progress, challenges, etc. (the good and the bad, their raw thoughts and feelings) 
At All Hands and in weekly emails to the company, simply tell the raw truth. Do not hide challenges and setbacks. Instead, bare them openly. This step will create deep trust.
Not only share the facts, but also share your thoughts and, most importantly, your feelings. 
“Since I communicated with you last, here is what made me feel Joy and Excitement. And here is what made me feel Sadness, Fear, and Anger.” 
This transparency of thought and emotion will make you relatable, just like the Protagonist in the Hollywood film. It will create trust and connection with your team. 
If you want help in sharing transparently and vulnerably, get a good public speaking coach. They are inexpensive relative to the massive value that they can deliver.
Once you correctly identify the problems and concerns, then state exactly what you are going to do to address them.

So, for people to feel fully inspired, all of the above must be occurring. But if you want to jumpstart things, start with being transparent and vulnerable in All Hands. You will be shocked at the positive reception.","Article discusses creating inspiring leadership by addressing meaningful problems, connecting with employees, showing progress, and fostering transparency and trust."

Exhibit 99.1
 

To our shareowners:
The American Customer Satisfaction Index recently announced the results of its annual survey, and for the 8th year in a row customers ranked Amazon #1. The United Kingdom has a similar index, The U.K. Customer Satisfaction Index, put out by the Institute of Customer Service. For the 5th time in a row Amazon U.K. ranked #1 in that survey. Amazon was also just named the #1 business on LinkedIn’s 2018 Top Companies list, which ranks the most sought after places to work for professionals in the United States. And just a few weeks ago, Harris Poll released its annual Reputation Quotient, which surveys over 25,000 consumers on a broad range of topics from workplace environment to social responsibility to products and services, and for the 3rd year in a row Amazon ranked #1.
Congratulations and thank you to the now over 560,000 Amazonians who come to work every day with unrelenting customer obsession, ingenuity, and commitment to operational excellence. And on behalf of Amazonians everywhere, I want to extend a huge thank you to customers. It’s incredibly energizing for us to see your responses to these surveys.
One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before. It may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before – in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones, customers can read reviews, compare prices from multiple retailers, see whether something’s in stock, find out how fast it will ship or be available for pick-up, and more. These examples are from retail, but I sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at Amazon and most other industries as well. You cannot rest on your laurels in this world. Customers won’t have it.
How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There’s no single way to do it – it’s a combination of many things. But high standards (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are certainly a big part of it. We’ve had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high expectations of customers. We’ve also had billions of dollars’ worth of failures along the way. With those experiences as backdrop, I’d like to share with you the essentials of what we’ve learned (so far) about high standards inside an organization.
Intrinsic or Teachable?
First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable? If you take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be taller. Do we first and foremost need to select for “high standards” people? If so, this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so. I believe high standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread. And though exposure works well to teach high standards, I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards, which I hope to share in this letter.
Universal or Domain Specific?
Another important question is whether high standards are universal or domain specific. In other words, if you have high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards elsewhere? I believe high standards are domain specific, and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest. When I started Amazon, I had high standards on inventing, on customer care, and (thankfully) on hiring. But I didn’t have high standards on operational process: how to keep fixed problems fixed, how to eliminate defects at the root, how to inspect processes, and much more. I had to learn and develop high standards on all of that (my colleagues were my tutors).
 

Understanding this point is important because it keeps you humble. You can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots. There can be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even know that your standards are low or non-existent, and certainly not world class. It’s critical to be open to that likelihood.
Recognition and Scope
What do you need to achieve high standards in a particular domain area? First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the scope.
Let me give you two examples. One is a sort of toy illustration but it makes the point clearly, and another is a real one that comes up at Amazon all the time.
Perfect Handstands
A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing handstand. No leaning against a wall. Not for just a few seconds. Instagram good. She decided to start her journey by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while but wasn’t getting the results she wanted. So, she hired a handstand coach. Yes, I know what you’re thinking, but evidently this is an actual thing that exists. In the very first lesson, the coach gave her some wonderful advice. “Most people,” he said, “think that if they work hard, they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting.” Unrealistic beliefs on scope – often hidden and undiscussed – kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be – something this coach understood well.
Six-Page Narratives
We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.
In the handstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to recognize high standards. It wouldn’t be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. The writing example is very different. The difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find that much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable.
Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.
Skill
Beyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope, how about skill? Surely to write a world class memo, you have to be an extremely skilled writer? Is it another required element? In my view, not so much, at least not for the individual in the context of teams. The football coach doesn’t need to be able to throw, and a film director doesn’t need to be able to act. But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope. Even in the example of writing a six-page memo, that’s

teamwork. Someone on the team needs to have the skill, but it doesn’t have to be you. (As a side note, by tradition at Amazon, authors’ names never appear on the memos – the memo is from the whole team.)
Benefits of High Standards
Building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort, and there are many benefits. Naturally and most obviously, you’re going to build better products and services for customers – this would be reason enough! Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards – they help with recruiting and retention. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the “invisible” but crucial work that goes on in every company. I’m talking about the work that no one sees. The work that gets done when no one is watching. In a high standards culture, doing that work well is its own reward – it’s part of what it means to be a professional.
And finally, high standards are fun! Once you’ve tasted high standards, there’s no going back.
So, the four elements of high standards as we see it: they are teachable, they are domain specific, you must recognize them, and you must explicitly coach realistic scope. For us, these work at all levels of detail. Everything from writing memos to whole new, clean-sheet business initiatives. We hope they help you too.","Amazon's shareholder letter highlights customer satisfaction rankings, employee dedication, and the importance of high standards in achieving success."

Three key inputs: 
clearly defined recurring meetings 
clearly pre-defined written template for each of those meetings 
only four appropriate responses to questions (see image below)


These might have changed since my time there, but the meeting cadence looked like this:
OP1/OP2 (annual planning)
Exec offsite: only steam...5 years out. When I was there it was: what do we have to believe to achieve $100B by 2015. 
This was framework/guidance for bottoms up planning process...
S-team goals
At the end of the planning cycle, the s-team would finalize a list of 5-10+ key objectives across the company and a list of 100 or so ""s-team"" SMART goals. 
Status was reported out on in WBR/MBR, and the steam would get together every quarter to review red/yellow/green and why red/yellow or status
WBR (weekly business review)
Company wide on Wednesday
Individual teams would have their ""pre-wbr"" reviews on Tuesdays to prepare for the company WBR
The template was a printed (not projected, although I heard they finally shifted to projected a couple years ago) deck of the top 15-20 output and input metrics for the business (weekly/monthly values, WoW/YoY/var to plan)
MBR or QBR (monthly or quarterly business review - we went back and forth between monthly and quarterly)
Written six page doc, outline was provided including standard financial templates. Provided update on status vs. goals - including key initiatives identified in annual plan and steam goals
New ideas/proposed solutions (ad hoc)
Decision maker was always clear
Everyone reads
Go around the room for feedback
Verbal discussion (see note below on what was appropriate verbal responses to questions)
Decision maker makes decision (yes/no, more data needed, etc.)
What is most unique about how meetings are run at Amazon is how little talking (or even back and forth feedback) there is - even after reading the document. The below provides some insight into why...very concise, focused writing, and very clear agreement on what is useful verbal communication. There is also an underlying, extreme level of rigor and data...if it is knowable, it is expected to be known - which is surprisingly rare in other companies. Knowable data points are typically lost in ""weasel"" words and talk.



Tips for Amazon writers:
Use less than 30 words per sentence
Due to the fact that → because
Totally lacked the ability to → could not
Replace adjectives with data
We made the performance faster → We reduced server-side tp90 latency from 10 ms to .1 ms
Eliminate weasel words
Nearly all customers → 87% of Prime Members
Significantly better → +25 basis points (bps)
Does your writing pass the “so what” test?
If you get a question, reply with one of the four Amazon answers:
Yes
No

AORs (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v72Mozz6Zr-3Knzcd9yNcs1E8-QKk5NkTVmR6pIQj98/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Areas of Responsibility (AORs) (2 min)

""Tragedy of the commons."" When several people share responsibility for an action or process, often that action doesn't get done well or at all.
To prevent this from happening, group tasks into categories and assign each category to one—and only one— person. These are your Areas of Responsibility. Apple is famous for having pioneered AORs in Silicon Valley, but most successful tech companies now use this method.
Create a document listing every possible function in the company. Next to each function, list the responsible person. This is the AOR list. It serves as a company directory and ensures that no functions fall through the cracks. Ensure everybody in the company knows how to access the list and update it as new functions arise or responsibilities shift.
For an example, see sample AOR.
No single point of failure
A single point of failure is a function that one person performs when no one else has full knowledge of how that function works. If that person becomes sick or leaves the company, functionality suffers. A well-run company has no single point of failure. To create a team with no single point of failure, do two things:
Write down all processes. As soon as you or your team members find yourself doing something for the second time, you should write down exactly the steps of that process. Here is a Process Template. Place these written processes in a firm-wide Wiki. 


Cross-train a second person for each role. Map each function in the company (from the AORs) to a backup person. Have the backup person co-work with the primary until the backup knows how to perform the role. (Of course, having all of the processes already written down will vastly improve this training process. So have your team write down all the processes first.)
Implementation
An easy way to implement writing down the AORs and then writing down the Processes is this:
CEO writes down her Areas of Responsibility in the AOR template format and writes out (in a Google Doc) the process for one of her functions and links it to the AOR list. CEO shares with the exec team so they can see what the example looks like.


CEO carves 45 minutes out of the next Exec Team meeting or Quarterly Offsite. 
Why do this live and not asynchronously? Because many people will ""not know what to do"" and will get frustrated if they have to do this offline without the ability to ask questions in real-time. They don't want to do it wrong, and without the ability to have their work reviewed in real-time, they fear that they will get it wrong. Many will choose not to do it all rather than risk getting it wrong.
[15 minutes] Asks all members to write down their AORs in the same template format as well, in real-time. 
[15 minutes] All members review each other's writings and point out conflicts. 
For each conflict, if it can be resolved in 2 minutes or less, great. 
If not, ask that the participants create a written Issue/Proposed Solution to be decided in the upcoming Exec Team meeting or later that day if at an Offsite.
[15 minutes] Ask each Exec Team member to pick one function and write out (in a Google Doc) the process for completing it (or as much as they can write in 15 minutes), and link the doc next to the function in the AOR list.


Now all exec team members have the experience of implementing both the AORs and a process, ask each to their teams to 
Complete the AOR list
Each team member writes down one process per week. 
If this happens, every process in the entire company will likely get documented, and with a minimum of pain.","Assigning specific responsibilities to individuals prevents the ""tragedy of the commons."" Avoid single points of failure by documenting processes and cross-training."

There are several ways to create a trusted relationship between a Manager and her reports.
They include:
I notice and recognize the contributions you make.
I ask and remember the details about you as a human being.
I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers.
I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker.
I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution).
Let's dive deeper into each one.
Recognition
I notice and recognize the contributions you make. This action is quite simply Praise (13 min). Do it in every single 1-1, Team Meeting and All Hands Meeting. Carve out an amount of time (3-5 minutes) to declare this praise. 
In addition, I send direct messages to people each week, or even each day, to follow up and give appreciations (1 min). I block off one hour each week to do so. 
Personal relationship
I know and care about you as a human being. 
To show this on a superficial (but still meaningful) level, I ask and remember the details about you as a human being. 
This action creates Trust and Like (5 min). 
Collect this information in the next 1-1 that you have with each Report. 
1st 1-1 Meeting with Matt Mochary (5 min to read; 45 min to do)
In addition, start each 1-1, by saying ""Before we get started, can you please give me the update on (pick one: your significant other, your kids, your hobby, etc.)."" Then listen with genuine curiosity. 
I want to help you solve the challenges you face in your personal life, not just those in your work life. 
When asking about issues that you are facing in our 1-1s, I explicitly ask you about personal challenges that you are facing. I then help you unpack those and give them as much air-time as work issues. 
2nd (and beyond) 1-1 Meeting with Matt Mochary (2 min to read; 15 min to do)
Darkest Thoughts
I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers. 
I appreciate, acknowledge, accept or not, and create actions to address the thoughts about me. 
Feedback (15 min)
On the thoughts about the company, I help you get a resolution by helping you.

Bank vs Brokerage (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZd9N3Abfrphxt-f3uw2lx1ZZy7L5zHiObXRDisWGQk/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Bank versus Brokerage

“You have heard of bank bailouts, because banks fail regularly.  But you have never heard of a brokerage bailout, because brokerages don’t fail.”  

The next question becomes:  Where do I put my assets?

You have 3 choices:
Commercial Bank (ie- Citibank)
Investment Bank (ie- Goldman Sachs)
Brokerage (ie- Schwab)

All of these institutions are a combination of a brokerage firm and a bank.  The question is what percentage?  Because the banking operation is inherently risky (which is why it is regulated by the US government) and can lead to a bankruptcy of the overall entity.  The larger the banking operation, the more at risk the overall firm is.  

Why are banks risky?

Commercial banks will hold your cash and then lend it out to others.  The bank gets all of the upside of these loans and you bear all of the risk.  If the economy tanks and the loans go bad en masse, then the bank fails and (barring a federal intervention) all of your assets go to pay off the creditors of the bank itself.  Holding your money in a commercial bank (above the FDIC insured $250,000 per account holder) is a terrible idea.

Investment banks are similar to commercial banks in that they will use your money to generate profits on their own account.  The only difference is that investment banks are not restricted to loans.  They can make any kind of bet or investment with your assets.  The bank receives all of the upside, while you bear all of the risk.  Again, a terrible idea to hold your money at an investment bank.

Almost all commercial and investment banks do have a brokerage arm.  If you hold securities there, the firm cannot lend out these assets unless you sign a margin agreement.  A margin agreement allows you to receive a margin loan.  In that agreement, you also give the brokerage permission to loan at your securities.  However, if you never sign a margin agreement, the brokerage is not allowed to loan out your securities.  Most investment and commercial banks with a brokerage account also provide a relationship manager who is highly incented to get you to sign a margin agreement.

Some people feel that the largest few commercial and investment banks in the US, if they failed, would cause a catastrophic failure to the US economy, and therefore the US government will not allow them to fail.  These institutions are “too big to fail”.  If the investments made by these institutions go bad, the thinking is that the US government will step in a pay back all depositors 100%, as happened to the largest banks in the 2008 crisis. Therefore some feel that with this implied US government guarantee, it is safe to hold assets at the biggest institutions (JPMorganChase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc).  

There is some logic to this.  But it is faulty logic.  

Banks do provide services (wire transfer, bill pay, ATMs) that make it convenient to hold working capital (the amount of money needed to operate the business, or your personal life for 90 days) at a bank.  But beyond that amount, you want to keep your additional assets at an institution that is inherently stable and does not require the US government to bail them out.

And that is a company that is primarily a brokerage firm.  (ie- Schwab, Fidelity, Brex).  

These firms do not try to get each of their depositors to sign a margin agreement.  (And please DO NOT ever sign a margin agreement.)  And therefore the vast majority of securities held there are not loanable.  If you don’t sign a margin agreement,  whatever assets you place at a brokerage firm remain in your name, are only invested in the way that you direct, and you remain the sole beneficiary.  

That being said, a brokerage firm is still a business and can go bankrupt if its expenses exceed its revenues for a long period of time (though this is much less likely than at a bank that is almost sure to go bankrupt in a sharp economic downturn).  In that case, your assets do get tied up in bankruptcy court, with one exception:  US Treasuries.  US Treasuries are never held in custody.  They are always held for the beneficial owner.  If the brokerage firm were to go bankrupt, your US Treasury certificates would be sent directly to you, and not held by the bankruptcy court.

So, start by placing your liquid assets (above your working capital needs which are fine to leave at bank) in a brokerage firm.  Then invest all of the cash into US Treasuries while you decide on your investment strategy.","The article compares the risks of holding assets in commercial banks, investment banks, and brokerages, recommending brokerage firms for stability."

Video of Emilie Choi (Coinbase President and COO) explaining RAPIDs and Biz Ops (20 min)
As your company quickly scales, the young people you hired early in the company's life-cycle will manage bigger and bigger teams. Some will learn to be good managers fast enough. Others won't. 
In dealing with those who don't, you will be in a difficult situation. You want to be transparent with them that they are not succeeding. And then when you decide to ""layer"" them, you will also want to be transparent with them (they will find out anyway once you start recruiting and will feel betrayed if you didn't already inform them) so that they can be your partner in the search. You will likely feel fear that they will feel de-motivated and perform even worse (or leave) before you can hire, train, and onboard their replacement. (This fear is usually overblown, as most young managers look forward to learning from someone more experienced.) But whether or not you feel this fear, the reality is that you want the team's performance to improve now, and recruiting a new manager from the outside will take time. Much more time than you would like. So, how do you improve the team's performance now?
There is an answer.
Large tech companies like Google and Linkedin have created a function called Business Operations. This function is staffed mainly with top-tier consultants from Bain, McKinsey, and BCG. I first encountered Biz Ops at Coinbase, where Emilie Choi scaled the group out as the company was going through hypergrowth. The team was viewed as mini-CEOS who could:
Parachute into any problem area, dig in, and fix it.
Build and drive processes that help the company scale, including running quarterly business reviews, OKRs, etc.
Join a team where the manager was not succeeding, and take over the project and people management duties while keeping the former manager as the architect.
The former manager became the subject matter expert who determined the roadmap: ""These are the things that we need to get done, and this is how to do them.""
The Biz Ops person then managed the team to ensure that they completed the roadmap.
Effectively run any meeting and train managers on how to do so.
Act as Chief of Staff to the CEO.
This function has been a big success for Coinbase. I highly recommend that you create such a function.
One logical way to create this function is first to hire a Chief of Staff (2 min) that fits this spec. Once you have fully trained that person as your CoS, then have them hire another person like them (who reports to them) as the first smoke-jumper. This is now your Biz Ops department. Scale it up from there. 
You may already have a Biz Ops function that reports into Finance or Operations. That is fine. As CEO, you also need a Biz Ops team that reports directly to you and is therefore available to put out any fire in the company, not just those in Finance or Operations. The most efficient structure I have seen is not having another report to the CEO, but rather the CoS to the CEO hiring and managing the overall Biz Ops function. That way, the CEO gets direct access to the function without gaining another report.
It is essential that you always have one Biz Ops resource available. If your CoS or one of the Biz Ops folks wants to manage a department permanently, they may do so. But only after they hire and train their replacement for the CoS or Biz Ops role that they are vacating.
When you send in a smoke-jumper to aid a struggling Manager, it is critical that the Biz Ops person report to that Manager the entire time they are in this position. The role of the Biz Ops person is to make the Manager succeed, not report back what they discover. If, by contrast, the Biz Ops person continues to report to the Head of Biz Ops, the smoke-jumper will be viewed by the struggling Manager as a spy, ensuring a dysfunctional relationship and a bad ending.","Emilie Choi explains Biz Ops and RAPIDs in a 20-minute video, detailing how to improve team performance and manage struggling managers effectively."
Board feedback with Matt Mochary (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPsqJVz37Gs3Fy48w57pGzAdB905OtZ4ZRCvaM2B07U/edit ,"Board feedback with Mochary (4 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about receiving feedback (5 min)
In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the Board and the CEO.
As Board Members, we want to share our knowledge and network with the founder to help her succeed (and therefore make our investment more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass that founder, so we rarely give our full critical feedback, and certainly not in a board meeting group setting.
As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our advisors and board members. But we often forget to ask for full critical feedback specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.
Both the withholding from the board members and not asking for feedback from the founder cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.
The exercise:
We schedule 80-minutes together. All board members, the CEO, and Matt.
All do the following pre-reads: 
This doc (5 min) 
Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s (3 min)
If you want to know even more, you can read Feedback (15 min) 
If you are the type of person that likes to do pre-work, please do Steps 3a and 3b before the meeting. 
If you run best by acting in the moment, you can do Steps 3a and 3b live in the meeting.
During that meeting/call 
Each board member creates a private scratchpad for themselves.  I recommend a blank Google Doc.
Each board member writes down in that scratchpad what actions the CEO has done that they LIKE, and what steps they WISH THAT the CEO would do (or not do). [10 minutes] 
Please give the rawest WISH THAT feedback that you can think of. 
If you write multiple points, please place the most important one to you at the top.
The CEO will unpack only the rawest of this feedback. 
Yes, it's a competition!
During this writing time, the CEO can respond to emails.
All paste their feedback into the shared doc. 
Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. [5 minutes] 
The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship. 
Each person reads their top WISH THAT to the CEO [5 minutes]
We can’t really understand the full message until we read it AND hear it spoken as well.
All read through the remainder of the WISH THAT feedback. [5 minutes] 
Each person adds in comment +1 to WISH THAT feedback from others that they agree with. 
After the CEO completes hearing and reading WISH THAT feedback from a person, he says ""Thank you (name of person)"" to confirm that he has heard or read their feedback.
The CEO picks the juiciest WISH THAT feedback and fully unpacks it by following this script: Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A's [10 minutes] 
Ask
Acknowledge
Appreciate
Accept
Action.
The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WISH THATs until the meeting time is over or all of the juicy feedback has been processed. [50 minutes] 
If there is enough time, it is ideal to unpack each board member's top issue (so that each feels heard).
All need to recognize that board members are highly qualified to give feedback in some areas (the effectiveness and efficiency of the board meeting, their interaction with the CEO) and less qualified in other areas (how to run the company). It doesn't mean that board members shouldn't give feedback in areas they are not as qualified in; it just means the CEO will be putting that feedback through a more stringent filter to see whether it resonates with him/her.
You may be thinking, ""Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt."" Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the feedback as an attack, not a gift. This response rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And it is why Matt is there. 
If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release their anger and see the feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if he is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.
Notes:
I have done this exercise at Confluent, Reddit, Sonder, Mattermost, Viz, etc. And each of those boards and CEOs have found it to be worthwhile. If anything, they've wanted it to be longer.


The full version of this exercise takes 80 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.


If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then here is the follow-up: 
CEO asks for written feedback at the end of every board meeting.
CEO treats all feedback as the gift it is.
After the CEO has read the feedback (can be after the board meeting), she lets the board know what actions she will be taking.
At the beginning of the next board meeting, she lets the board know which of these actions she has completed and the results.
If the board members are open to it, the CEO gives written feedback to each board member in their subsequent interaction (likely 1-1).
","Board feedback exercise involves board members, CEO, and coach Matt for honest, critical feedback sharing and processing for improved communication."
Board Meeting - Best Practice (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDGVUYHPyQGHjcIVpqQP9dRjABWjU_VoVdtMDdtNDOk/edit ,"Board Meeting - Best Practice

The best board meeting is one that gives board members enough information to allow them to be helpful to you. Be transparent. Be vulnerable. If you do, the board will reward you with rich and valuable feedback.
Here are my board meeting best practices:
Share the board meeting information with all board members in writing at least 3 days (but preferably 7 days) in advance of the meeting. 


Format: Memo or deck. With a short video. 


My preference is a memo, as it lends itself more to reading.


Some CEOs are now starting to include short Loom videos (less than 5 minutes) that run through all of the most important ideas in the memo. Board members LOVE this as they can watch at 1.5x speed.  


This replaces the CEO’s opening walk-through in the board meeting itself.

 
Information included: 


Update 
KPIs, including 
Summary Financials
Product Roadmap
Hiring Roadmap
Sales Pipeline
What we accomplished last quarter (OKRs)
For each KPIs and OKRs 
Green, yellow, red label (on track, off track, far off track)
The good
The not good
And what we are going to do to fix it
What we hope to accomplish next quarter (OKRs)


Issues 
One or two strategic questions or problems with which we are grappling. (Could be from the Update above.) 
The issue of choice written out thoroughly 
Our proposed solution


Most board members have far more visibility than you as to what other companies have experienced when tackling forward-looking strategic questions or operations at other companies. I.e
Should we expand to Europe? 
Should we launch an adjacent product?
Have other companies done layoffs and what have their experiences been with it?


By contrast, you have much more context than your board members on internal operating issues. I.e.
Our CMO is struggling, what should we do?


Stick to the questions where your board has more visibility than you do.


Requests 
Specific action requests of board members 
Most board members have strong networks. Take advantage of this by asking for warm introductions to potential customers, partners, etc.
Feedback 
Ask the board: 
How could this board meeting be more effective?
How could I (as CEO) be more effective?


Collect responses 
Ask board members to pose questions and write responses to the board packet at least two days before the meeting.


During the next 48 hours, you, or your internal team, write up answers to all board member questions.


Meet (phone call) with board members 1-1 just before the board meeting to 
Ensure that they have ingested the information


Elicit their questions, concerns, etc., so that they come to the board meeting already feeling heard (this is critical for creating trust). 

At the board meeting 


Cause everyone to get present for the meeting.
I like to start with a short exercise to get everyone in a positive mood and have us know each other a bit more as humans.
Each board member shares one fun thing (in 30 seconds or less) that they have experienced since the last board meeting.  
If there are more than 6 people present, the verbal sharing becomes too long. In that case, I limit the sharing to only board members, not observers, lawyers nor execs.  And if there are more than 6 board members, then I skip this.


Answer the questions received about the board packet.


Invite the executive team to attend. This allows board members and executives to get to know each other and gain comfort with each other. 


Each exec will have contributed to the board memo. You can offer each 2-3 minutes to give a verbal summary of their department update.


Allow the execs to participate in the strategic issue discussion (below).


Unpack one strategic question or issue. 


Ask for each board member's view. Give equal air time. 
If your board members are willing to write, use Issue / Proposed Solution template
Allow Board observers and lawyers to write, but not to speak unless you specifically ask for their input.


Unpack the second issue.


Confirm that each board member is willing to do the actions requested.


Closed-door session. 


Ask that all non-board members leave the room, leaving only board members and the lawyer.


Collect written feedback if it wasn't already collected in response to the board packet.


Closing ceremony: to remind each other that we're on the same team


For this, I like to have each board member thank one other person in the room for something that they did.  Once a person is thanked, they can’t be thanked again (so that everyone gets thanked for something).   The CEO thanks last, since she has something to thank each person about. 

Social time 


It is often healthy to create an informal social venue for board members and the executive team. This is usually a meal before or after the meeting. 


Board observers and lawyers are usually not invited to this gathering.","Best board meetings involve transparency, vulnerability, and thorough preparation with memos, videos, strategic questions, feedback, and a structured agenda."

It is essential to have a set of thought partners to keep you accountable for picking the best goals and then marching toward those goals. This can be a coach, an advisory board, or your actual board. As a corporation, you must have regular board meetings. Therefore, if you trust and like your actual board members, making them your thought partners is the best practice. If that is the case, then I follow the ""Best Practice"" model below. If you do not have complete trust in your board, I highly recommend that you get to a place of absolute confidence (through facilitation and/or replacing board members). But if you are still unable to create the board of complete trust right now, then follow the ""Minimal"" model below.

Keep the board to an odd number of seats (to avoid a dead-locked vote) and as few seats as possible. The ideal number is three. Try very hard not to go beyond five.
Board observers are supposed to observe only during a board meeting and not talk unless asked a direct question by a board member. Enforce this behavior.
Give the board members all the information they need at a board meeting (or even better, before the board meeting) in writing so that they have few or no questions during the meeting. The best way to do this is to: 
Create a complete presentation with 
complete financials and metrics/KPIs
write-up of the good and the bad from these metrics
what we accomplished since the last board meeting (OKRs)
what we plan to accomplish at the next board meeting (OKRs)

After the board presentation, where there are hopefully few to no questions:
Give the board members homework.

But they also are then not likely to give you unsolicited advice. This is the true goal of the homework. 
If a board member does give you advice, take notes. Summarize what the board member said, and ask if you got it right. Once they say ""Yes, that's right,"" thank them for their advice and let them know that you will seriously consider it in formulating your go-forward plan.

Board of Directors (4 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yL0SGQX0Hzan7Jm8tS7wrHiaGxPhFVmdxidCSCoWKhM/edit ,"Board of Directors (4 min)
When a board of directors and a CEO function well, board members act as lieutenants to the CEO. The board also holds the CEO accountable, and if the CEO becomes dysfunctional, the board fires her and hires another. This is the proper role of an effective board. Unfortunately, most boards are not functional.
By law, C Corporations must have a board of directors, which must meet regularly to be informed about the company's operations and provide fiduciary oversight. Organizations are incorporated to shield their owners from personal liability for the debts of the company. If a corporation does not have a board of directors nor holds proper board meetings, then someone who the company has injured can sue the organization and ""pierce the corporate veil,"" making the owners individually liable for the misdeeds of the entity. No owner wants this. Therefore board meetings have great utility in keeping you in good standing with the law and your shareholders safe from liability.
Unfortunately, that is usually where the utility of a board of directors and board meetings ends. While there may be boards that provide helpful and timely guidance to a CEO, most do not. In some cases, boards are passive and offer little help but also little pain. Unfortunately, board members are actually contentious in most cases, advising with little to no knowledge of the company or the industry and then getting frustrated (and even combative) if the CEO does not follow their advice.
As CEO, you are immersed in your company's operations at least 20 working days a month. Your board members only learn what you can share with them during the board meeting (which occurs once a month, or once a quarter, etc.). The board members, therefore, cannot possibly have the full context. Yet many feel the need to give advice. And once you give that advice, because most have large egos, they want you to follow it. If it isn't, they can often feel resentful toward the CEO, which is very dangerous. 
Because boards can hire and fire the CEO, if enough board members get their feelings bruised from unfollowed advice, the CEO may find herself looking for a new job.
There are other pitfalls to a board:
A board with an even number of board seats (i.e., 4, 6, etc.) can have a deadlocked vote. Even if the issue is a simple one, this can cause an existential crisis if there is no way to break the deadlock.


A board with many board members requires lots of maintenance as board members often want to have 1-1 conversations with the CEO on major issues and be heard in the board meetings.
There are ways to avoid these pitfalls. Here are my ""board best practices"":
Keep the board to an odd number of seats and as few seats as possible. The ideal number is three. Try very hard not to go beyond five.


Board observers are supposed to observe only during a board meeting and not talk unless asked a direct question by a board member. Enforce this behavior.

About this doc
Below is a template for aligning a company on desired outcomes (goals) and actions (to-do’s to get to those goals.)  The end goal is for every team member’s individual actions to connect to the larger company vision and desired outcomes.

It’s broken down into these categories:
Customer discovery and revenue
Outcomes (company, department, and individual levels)
Actions (company, department, and individual levels)


For the decision maker:
Please send this template to whomever you would like input from when it comes to forming the company outcomes and actions.  You should send it only to the people whose responses you’re willing to read.  (If you’re <20 people, you can likely send and process the entire company’s input.  For any teams larger than that, try to select for a pool that is representative of the overall company.)

Once you’ve received everyone’s answers, process them with the appropriate department heads, and then publish the results and findings once they are ready to the entire company.

One of the most powerful tools that I know of is co-writing. It allows ...
Sharing of much more information per minute than talking.
Everyone to share their ideas, even those who are quieter during verbal discussion.
People to feel heard and therefore buy-in to the decisions that eventually get made.
I encourage you to experiment with it one time. See the results. If you like them, continue.
To do so …
Step 1:  Collect everyone’s thoughts.
Open a shared Google Doc, Notion, Coda, ClickUp page, etc.
             
Pose a written question or request.


State the question or request verbally. 


This step may seem redundant, but neither written nor verbal presentation alone transmits the complete picture. Each transmits about half.  The written words are good at transmitting facts.  The spoken words are good at transmitting emotion and nuance.  


To get a full understanding, therefore, we need to ingest the information by both reading and hearing it.


Then ask everyone to write their thoughts on their private doc for 3-5 minutes and paste the final to the shared doc. 


This is so that the primary doc doesn't bounce around as people actively write in it at the same time.


Then take 5-10 minutes for everyone to ingest each other's thoughts. 


Ask everyone to +1 other people's thoughts when they agree so that you can visually see what the common sentiments are.


If there are less than 5-10 participants, you can ask each person to share their write-up verbally in 1 minute or less (be strict about time-keeping here!). 


If there are more than 5-10 participants, it will take too much time to allow all to speak their thoughts.  In this case, everyone simply reads the write-ups.


The facilitator or decision-maker can now ask clarifying questions of any person they want to understand more from, but they don't need to.


The first step is now complete. You have now collected a massive amount of information and made everyone on your team feel heard ... in less than 20 minutes!


CONGRATULATIONS!
Step 2:  The decision-maker takes the thoughts away, formulates a proposed solution asynchronously (which does not even need to include any of the thoughts garnered from the brainstorm) and returns at a future meeting to the group with the proposed solution in the Issue / Proposed Solution template.  All involved will feel that they at least got a chance to be heard before the proposed solution was formulated. 




Here is a way to go from problem identification all the way to solution:
Define the problem 
All participants to open a private Google Doc. Spend 5 minutes framing the issue.
Open a shared Google Doc. All copy-paste their definition into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite. Decision-maker to pick one. 


Propose the solution 
All participants spend 10 minutes writing their proposed solution in their private doc.	
All copy-paste their answer into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite. 

Decide 
Decision-maker spends 5-10 minutes asking clarifying questions.
Chooses a solution. 

Further questions 
If the Decision-Maker is not able to choose, she writes out a set of questions.
All to spend 10 minutes writing their answers to the questions.
All copy-paste their answers into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite choice. Decision-maker picks one.


Async questions 
If the Decision-Maker is still not able to choose, she writes out another round of questions.
Adjourn decision to the following group meeting.
All to asynchronously write their answers to the questions and further proposed solutions.
All copy-paste their answers into the shared doc.
At the next meeting, all read all entries. Vote on their favorite choice. Decision-maker picks one.","Co-writing is a powerful tool for brainstorming, allowing everyone to share ideas and feel heard, leading to efficient decision-making."

# Bias Towards Action

### Introduction:  Bias towards action

Over the years, I have trained myself to get things done efficiently and quickly.  As a result, people often say, “Wow, how do you get so much done in so little time?!”  The truth is, I’m not special.  Anyone can learn to do this.  The secret is having a **bias towards action**.

The “bias towards action” method worked for me ...

- now as the COO of 🔗 [Mochary Method](http://mocharymethod.com) as we build the Method into software and simultaneously train world-class coaches
- when I was Chief of Staff to Matt Mochary and had to help him 🔗 [feel like a Superhuman](https://www.notion.so/Help-Execs-Prioritize-Work-4fc93b61edd24430868275148e9c6889?pvs=21)
- when I was Head of Operations at On Deck and tasked with launching 20+ fellowships in 2021, and
- when I bootstrapped my first company, a boutique music school, to $1mm in ARR

Below is the framework I use.

[*Jump to the top...*](https://www.notion.so/Bias-towards-action-730451d4d9324001b0104911911e3581?pvs=21)

### Step 1:  Do you need to do it?

First, just because you *can* get something done, doesn’t mean you should.

And just because someone has asked you to do something, doesn’t mean you should do it.

Before you agree to do something, **remember that for every request you say “yes” to, you’re saying “no” to something else.**  Is that trade-off worth it?

Here are a few more questions you can ask yourself:

> If you are a manager: how important is it for you yourself to do it?  Instead, can you delegate it to one of your direct reports?
> 

> If you are an individual contributor: is the task in harmony with what your manager’s priorities are?  Is it in the company’s best interest?*
> 

**For a deeper understanding on what “company’s best interest” means, please read* 🔗 **[No Rules Rules](https://www.norulesrules.com/) *by Reed Hastings.  Here is an* 🔗 *[excellent summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU0WiVVu2ZiINORMaO0Nyf7eR0isc5NO-Xi7RG6YaNY/edit) on the book by Matt Mochary.*

TL;DR:  **should you say yes to that thing?**  Think carefully about the time spent and the payoff for doing it.

👉  **Here’s a tip:**  try to say yes to things that are *only* full-bodied “yes.”  That means saying yes when your head, heart, and gut are all in agreement.  (Hat tip to 🔗 [Kat Agostino](https://www.svexecutivecoaching.com/about) for this amazing insight.)

<aside>
☝ *Regina’s personal experience:*

I used to have a hard time saying no to people and tasks that didn’t energize me.  Then, one day, I realized that **everything I said half-bodied “yes”es to zapped away time that Matt needed me working on high-output tasks.**

As a result, I started experimenting with valuing my time at the same cost as Matt’s hourly rate.

The result:  All of a sudden, it became much easier to say no.

### Step 2a:  Is this the best thing I can be doing with my time right now?

If you have decided that it is, indeed, *worth it* to do the task and that it’s in the company’s best interest, the next step is to ask yourself:  **Is this the most important task on my plate right now?**

When I decide how to structure my work day and what stuff I’ll get done, I first consult my **Actions Towards Goals.**

  💡 Here is a framework for figuring out your actions towards goals:

1. **Look at your company’s goals.**  This can exist in the form of an MVV (Mission, Vision, Values), OKRs and KPIs, or a Product Roadmap if your company is pre-product market fit.
    
    *For further reading on Product Roadmap, please read* 🔗 *[this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlphokiVnRnsRDKA_d48QIpmy5VBBfn4760wS8WfQ1Q/edit).*
    
    *For further reading on Mission, Vision, and Values, take a look at MM’s vision doc* 🔗 *[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXIRwcdiAGL_eI7EYQMkgFvPhq_DW-pRqfOzZ2V-ghs/edit).*
    
2. **Look at your Areas of Responsibility (AORs).**  If your company doesn’t have an AOR list, I highly encourage you to help them implement one.  That way, there is no ambiguity in who owns what processes across the entire org.
    
    *To implement AORs,* 🔗 *[check this out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v72Mozz6Zr-3Knzcd9yNcs1E8-QKk5NkTVmR6pIQj98/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337).*
    
3. **Look at your action tracker.**  Look at the agreements you’ve made with others on the tasks you have promised.
    
    *For further information, I recommend checking out my* 🔗 *[Asana as an Agreements Tracker playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiksA_rhPy74zJQ9VcSnI7XDMZIinyifG) to see how to implement one in your org.*
    

If you’re a manager, your main job is likely following up on actions with your immediate team and cross-functionally with other department heads.

If you’re an IC, your main job is likely working on projects your manager and you have collectively agreed on you owning.

### Step 2b:  Example: company goals → personal work goals → action

*👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)*

Below are screenshots from my own personal actions tracker.  I answer the following questions, step by step:

1. **What are the company goals?**
2. **Based on those goals, what should my work goals be?**
3. **What are the actions I can do to finish those goals?**

*Regina’s example...*

1. Here are my current company goals, pulled from our 🔗 [Mission, Vision, Values doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1MXIRwcdiAGL_eI7EYQMkgFvPhq_DW-pRqfOzZ2V-ghs/edit).
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-02 at 9.21.35 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/96224a83-c294-4a26-9754-18a2bc71a7ec/Screen_Shot_2022-04-02_at_9.21.35_PM.png)
    
2. Here is how I’ve chosen my Actions Towards Goals (notice that each section has one action item: product, people, and self.)
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-02 at 9.24.17 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4acade5f-2575-43fc-b834-ab10d93588d9/Screen_Shot_2022-04-02_at_9.24.17_PM.png)
    
3. And as a result, here is what I choose to do daily because *it is the best use of my time:*
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-04-02 at 9.29.08 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d4a2d526-36be-41ae-8f54-9a75d832bedb/Screen_Shot_2022-04-02_at_9.29.08_PM.png)
    

After going through this line of questioning, it becomes abundantly clear what I have to do to move the needle forward.  Everything else is a distraction.

I reevaluate this list of priorities on a weekly basis to make sure I’m still on track.

[*Jump to the top...*](https://www.notion.so/Bias-towards-action-730451d4d9324001b0104911911e3581?pvs=21)

### Step 3a:  How can I make this action happen in the next 30 minutes?

Recently, I was teaching 🔗 [Nate Forster](https://twitter.com/nateforster_), [Matt Mochary](https://twitter.com/mattmochary)’s newest Chief of Staff and my successor in the role, how to get sh*t done quickly.

I taught Nate that if he wanted to be massively productive, any time someone gave him a task he decided was worth doing, or he assigned himself something, I encouraged him to ask himself that question.

He then joked that Frank Slootman, the CEO of Snowflake, wrote in his book 🔗 [*Amp It Up](https://ampitupbook.com/)* that the #1 question he asked his team was, *“What can we do to make this happen today?”*

I suppose, then, my mantra is just Frank Slootman’s mantra on steroids: **“How can I make this action happen in the next 30 minutes?”**

![*This was the post-it that inspired Nate to ask me about bias towards action, and actually the post-it that started this entire blog post.*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/590a1bc7-a74b-4562-a7fc-f27e9ed062e8/IMG_1097.heic)

*This was the post-it that inspired Nate to ask me about bias towards action, and actually the post-it that started this entire blog post.*

One of the biggest hurdles of having a bias towards action is **expecting perfection right from the get-go**.

Rather than ...

- jumping down the rabbit hole of hypothetical “what-ifs” that never happen, or
- waiting to ship until a product is utterly perfect,

...instead, optimizing for getting *something* in front of an audience and iterating from there is the best way to make progress towards goals.

☝️  *A note for managers:*

When I work with my team, I find that this is a helpful prompt in promoting a bias towards action culture.  It puts them in the driver’s seat, helps them lean into their autonomy, and gives them decision-making power.

In fact, the semantics here matter.

Matt and I have gotten in a habit of requesting that our teammates **declare** what they’re going to do and actively solicit our feedback.

- This toggle contains an example of what you can send to your direct reports to challenge them into acting with autonomy.  Notice how I write to Sabrina, “**What do you intend to do?**”  This has worked for every person who reports to me, regardless of their seniority level.

### Step 3b:  Example:  Ship it faster than an MVP

*👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)*

One great example I have on truncating timelines is **Mochary Method’s work using no-code.**

First, custom software takes a long time to build.

[Mochary Method](http://mocharymethod.com) is creating the all-in-one solution for startups to run their companies effectively.  But we all know that takes a long time.  So, what next?

The solution:  **I was curious on whether no-code could be an effective solution for prototyping our software.**

So, a few months ago, we began working with [Joe Brown](https://twitter.com/cuhpajo) and the team at 🔗 [Smaal Co](https://smaal.co/) to get an MVP off the ground, all built in Bubble.

![*Joe ([@cuhpajo](http://twitter.com/cuhpajo)) is so excited to launch our app that he’s throwing out all sorts of teasers about it.  If you’re reading this... now you know what he’s talking about.  :)*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/79b78583-df84-42eb-9c40-59e666ee218f/Screen_Shot_2022-04-08_at_10.04.09_PM.png)

*Joe ([@cuhpajo](http://twitter.com/cuhpajo)) is so excited to launch our app that he’s throwing out all sorts of teasers about it.  If you’re reading this... now you know what he’s talking about.  :)*

We were given an estimate that our entire software would take around four months to build.  MVPs are supposed to be the quickest things to ship, right?  Right.  So that should be the fastest we can get something off the ground.

But what if that was wrong?

We had an even more radical idea:  what if we could build *another* tool concurrently that could be shipped in a matter of weeks?  This would prove whether we could even build a proper MVP in Bubble to begin with.

Using the same “30-minutes” thinking principle, I challenged Joe to build us a no-code tool, with design and database architecture able to integrate into the larger tool, all in a matter of two weeks.

Sure enough, Joe said yes.  And two weeks later, we had a product that worked!  This gave us the confidence that we could, indeed, prototype using Bubble.

![*The proposal to craft a working prototype complete with design and database architecture in a matter of days.*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e24e33c5-7f37-4d2c-8b59-4255f3ca0cb8/Screen_Shot_2022-04-08_at_10.23.03_PM.png)

*The proposal to craft a working prototype complete with design and database architecture in a matter of days.*

![*The resulting prototype, built in a matter of days and ready to test.*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6cfbc365-dc91-48ac-bd19-2c93f848b3e6/CleanShot_2022-04-08_at_22.29.48.gif)

*The resulting prototype, built in a matter of days and ready to test.*

But why stop there?  We were on a roll and loved no-code.  After completing that project, we asked: **was there another piece the Smaal Team could create in the same timeline?**

When we asked, Joe say he could build us another tool on our Santa’s wishlist of no-code products, but that tool would take at least month.  What followed was a conversation of how we could make it happen faster.

This first photo is of the proposal suggesting our tool be built in a four-week timeline, with some added time for QA testing before launch.

![*Initial proposal: 4 week timeline.*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d9a90bb8-c9e4-46de-b14f-3bc57e24f5f6/Screen_Shot_2022-04-08_at_10.33.05_PM.png)

*Initial proposal: 4 week timeline.*

The next photo was my back-and-forth conversation with Joe on what action items he could take to make the development go faster, which resulted in an accelerated timeline.

![blurred.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7bb49ce6-d247-4f66-8a41-6b06aba2824e/blurred.png)

In the end, we ended up agreeing to ship the Energy Audit tool in a little over two weeks.  This was faster than the original suggested timeline of a month (or more!), just because I asked:  “How can we make this happen faster?”

[*Jump to the top...*](https://www.notion.so/Bias-towards-action-730451d4d9324001b0104911911e3581?pvs=21)

### Step 4:  What can I accomplish before someone assigns me an action?

The final step (Frank Slootman’s mantra on double-steroids) is:

> *What action items can I give myself and do to make this goal happen before anyone assigns me an action item?*
> 

An operator’s greatest superpower is being able to **predict the needs of the organization before anyone asks them to do it.**

This means *preemptively* going through the logic tree in [Step 2a](https://www.notion.so/Bias-towards-action-730451d4d9324001b0104911911e3581?pvs=21) and giving yourself action items to act on before anyone else does it for you.

This is shockingly simple to implement.  All you have to do is **ask yourself what actions you need to take to reach the goals.**

In order to better illustrate how to do this, I’ve left a few examples from various chapters of my own life on how Bias Towards Action might look as an IC, a manager, and a founder.

- *Regina’s example as an Individual Contributor*
    
    When I was Matt’s Chief of Staff, because Matt’s goals were effectively my goals, I would ask myself: “What is the next action item I can take to advance his goals before he even needs to *think* about asking me?”
    
    This could apply to literally anything.  Asking this question helped me:
    
    - draft emails for Matt to follow up with VIPs in his inbox (corresponding goal:  get Matt to Inbox Zero and connect with interesting people)
    - line up plane tickets and hotel options for his next trip (corresponding goal:  Restore)
    - suggest meeting times for the next retrospective to debrief with the Engineering team (goal:  ship V1 of software by the end of the year)
    
    The common theme was that **Matt’s life was now plug-and-play**:  he didn’t have to think because I did all the thinking for him.  This left him time and brain space to think about stuff that he *loved* thinking about: coaching and being the visionary of the software.
    
- *Regina’s example as a Manager*
    
    In my previous job, I saw that the company I worked for had ambitious goals of launching 20+ fellowships (our “product”) by 2Q21.  Here was my thought pattern which made it happen before anyone asked me to think about it:
    
    1. The company’s goal is to launch 20+ products by 2Q21.  Therefore, it is the Operations Department’s goal to put infrastructure and resourcing in place to handle 20+ products.
    2. What are the building blocks to make create *one* product happen?
    *Answer: playbook everything and document along the way.  Everyone needs to contribute to documentation efforts.*
    3. What is the minimum amount of resourcing we need to make *one* product?
    *Answer:  we need at least one director and one operations associate to launch, and one EA per 3-5 product launches.*
    4. With that number, what do we need to make *twenty* products?
    *Answer:  at least 20 operations associates, and at least 4 EAs to assist with said product launches provided we stagger product launches.*
    5. When do we need to start hiring by to hit our deadline of resourcing, training, and deploying operations associates?
    *Answer:  yesterday.  Next-best day is today.*
    6. Which departments do we have to collaborate with in the company to make this work?
    *Answer:  all of them.  Write out exactly what we need from every department and don’t stop until we get what we need from each of them.*
    
    The result of this bias-towards-action thinking was:
    
    1. We were able to launch all 20 products by our given timeline
    2. We were able to hire, train, and deploy 15 operations associates in one quarter
    3. We had playbooks in the Operations department written in the event that I needed to pass the role onto someone else
    4. The company was able to successfully raise $20mm in Series A funding, in part because of the hockey stick growth in revenue from the product launches
    
    ![*An example of one of the pieces of documentation created in order to accommodate scale.*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fc9f71f8-4f47-4651-a079-6e7bbba01ad1/blurred.png)
    
    *An example of one of the pieces of documentation created in order to accommodate scale.*
    
- *Regina’s example as a Founder*
    
    Lastly, I’ll share an example from my Founder days.  Before I was familiar with the term, we hit product-market fit.
    
    We had a waiting list of clients that was 1.5 years long, there were over 100 people in and out of my apartment-turned-music-studio every week, and I had clients that were throwing fistfuls of money in my face for the chance of getting music lessons using my methodology.
    
    Below was my line of questioning to go from a solo bootstrapper into a full-fledged music school.
    
    1. **What was the goal?**
    *Answer:  create the best, world-class piano school in all of Los Angeles county.*
    2. **What has to be true for that goal to happen?**
    *Answer:  I need to hire and train teachers to teach using my methodology.  I need training seminars and a way to make my methodology repeatable (therefore, documenting everything.)  Lastly, I need an actual music space: my tiny apartment isn’t cutting it anymore.*
    3. **What has to happen to make that scenario true?**
    *Answer:  Find, hire, and train two teachers to absorb my methodology.  Document and record everything along the way.  Find a commercial space by mid-1Q17.*
    4. **What is going to take the most time?**
    *Answer:  Finding the commercial space with the needed specs:  at least 1000 sqft for all the grand pianos, within budget, easy to access for parents, and soundproofing installed.*
    5. **What are the next actions?**
    *Answer:  After finding the space...*
        - *Negotiate for landlord-paid improvements to get walls, flooring, etc. covered to keep us in budget.  Offer to cover soundproofing since it’s a music business-specific expense.*
        - *Get building permits + get architect’s blueprints approved.*
        - *Cause building company to build the whole damn thing in 14 days.*
        - *Have a furniture-building party with friends to pitch in to open the school in time.*
    
    The results:  we opened our doors in February 2017, scaled to well over $500k in bootstrapped revenue during the first year, and ended up hiring a lean team of five people.  Because I started from the goal and planned for what we needed, we were instantly profitable from the get-go.  To this day, the school continues to live on.

""Financial planning is a huge pain right now. We have raised a lot of money, but we just seem to burn more money, and a lot of people are coming to the well asking for even more resources. The big issue is that I don't feel like we have any infrastructure in place to measure the ROI of the marginal investments that we make.  All of the execs want to be investing a lot, and I want to be more measured, and I feel like I'm an army of one pushing for more thoughtfulness.""
Sound familiar? If yes, you are not alone. And there are answers.
One effective method is market-based budgeting, where market is determined by looking at the P&Ls of comparable public companies.  Once you have the % of revenue that the comparables spend in each department, then you follow these steps:
Project revenue for the coming year.


Go to Sales and ask what resources they need to achieve that revenue.  If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.


Then go to Product and Engineering and ask what are the critical resources they need to build the key features on the Product Roadmap that will enable the projected revenue.  If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.


For the remaining departments, they are given a $ number based on the comparables.  (Brian Long of Attentive Mobile calls each of these budgets an “envelope”.)


The envelope should be an amount of $, not headcount.  If headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people.


Here is a video of Brian Long, CEO of Attentive Mobile, explaining the market-based budgeting system (12 minutes).  


Another method that Amazon has effectively used is the investment (outcomes-based) model. If people want an allocation of $, they must pitch for it, just as a founder would pitch an investment firm. The pitch must include projections of what results can be produced with the dollars. If the decision-maker is compelled, she will allocate the capital. But then there is a cadence of reporting (usually monthly check-ins) wherein the recipient of the capital must report on their progress (OKRs) and metrics (KPIs). Borrowing from the Bridgewater Associates model, people get scored on their ability to deliver their projected ROI. Those with higher scores get further access to capital. 
It is essential to do so in dollars when making allocations, not headcount, even though the dollars are primarily used for headcount. Why? Because if you use headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people. If their allocation is in dollars, however, they will optimize for output.
There are, however, several problems with the outcomes-based system.  Here are two:
When the outcomes don’t materialize, department heads begin to blame others in the org, because there is always some kind of dependency.   And it is difficult to hold department heads accountable, because the only meaningful consequence is letting them go, and that is often beyond what you want to do (and they know it).


It takes several iterations (and each iteration is a year if budgeting is annual) to get a meaningful score on a department head.",The article discusses challenges in budgeting and suggests market-based and outcomes-based models for effective financial planning.

Paul Graham of YCombinator, famously points out that makers (engineers) need long stretches of uninterrupted time to be productive, whereas managers are most effective when meeting. The compromise is to schedule days when no meetings are allowed. 
The thoughts below are to protect those who can only produce their best work when in a flow state, knowing that any distraction destroys a flow state. This guidance applies to engineers and designers. It likely does NOT apply to people in more operational roles.
By scheduling all internal meetings (1-1s, Team Meeting, and All Hands) on a single day, you also get two massive benefits:
You can use each 1-1 during the day as preparation for the Team Meeting at the end of the day. This action creates a super-high-quality and informed Team Meeting that causes each team member to be inspired by their peers (who are so well prepared).


You learn about issues from each person's perspective at the same moment in time (same day), and therefore can get an accurate 360-degree view and resolve it most effectively. 
The schedule that works best for a five-day workweek is:
One day of internal meetings for the Exec Team (1-1s, Team Meeting, and All Hands) 
A separate day of internal meetings for each Department
A separate day of internal meetings for each Team
One day of external meetings (i.e., interviewing candidates)
Three days of no meetings (with Slack off!)
It isn't critical when these days are, although it helps to space the two meeting days apart from each other.
The above schedule often comes under fire from recruiters, who worry that:
It won't be easy to conduct all onsite interviews on a single day.
Many qualified candidates won't be able to make it in on the appointed day.
First, your hire and close rate for candidates should be very high (approx. 75%)— otherwise, you are losing incredible amounts of time by doing all-day in-person interviews with many candidates you don't want to hire or don't want to work for you. Therefore, unless you are already hitting the 75% metric, you should start screening candidates more effectively (i.e., brutally) in your phone interviews and lower the number of in-person interviews.
Second, it is true that some candidates can only come on specific days or times. However, the benefits of having meetings on only one set day, as measured by the company's increased productivity, far outweigh the cost of losing out on a few candidates. Additionally, if the candidate cannot find the time to make it on a set day within two or three weeks, it is quite likely that they won't take the job anyway.
There are many other high-level candidates out there. You can find another one. But there are only a finite number of productive work hours within the company. Once lost, there is no way to recapture them.
There are two exceptions to the advice above:
In the very early days of a company, when a department has just one person. At that stage, the department lead can set a recruiting schedule that works for her as she builds her team. 


Departments that are entirely non-technical and don't require focused work time (i.e., Operations) or whose job it is to have external meetings (i.e., Sales).
The guidelines above are for when a team is already in place, which requires uninterrupted days for its work. This setup is particularly important for the Engineering team.
",Engineers need uninterrupted time; managers thrive in meetings. Schedule all internal meetings on one day for productivity and collaboration.

Most companies are so focused on improving that they forget to celebrate. But celebration, like fun, is a key to building positive morale. Celebration doesn't mean lavish drunken parties. Quite the opposite, celebration means taking a moment to appreciate the good that the company has achieved, as well as the good that departments, teams, and individuals have achieved. 
To celebrate:
Publicly acknowledge these achievements at All Hands and team meetings. 
Remember to celebrate the essential but often overlooked teams on the core product. 
You don't need to celebrate every team at every meeting. Create a rotation.
Create a standing demo meeting where teams can show off their most recent creations. 
This demo should not be a mandatory meeting but should occur over a meal (lunch) or drinks (Friday afternoon).
","Celebrating achievements in the workplace is crucial for positive morale. Acknowledge successes in meetings, rotate team celebrations, and host demo sessions."
CEO as fireman (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndhJME8Nx5yWa9tqhEMRwi5pgibYy6AzB46zhvSeFEg/edit ,"CEO as fireman (1 min)
A fireman lives in the firehouse, ready to respond to a fire whenever it comes. Most of the time, there is no fire to respond to, so the fireman waits. The most enterprising ones use that downtime to do something productive. 
The best CEOs that I coach do the same. They manage the executive team, but they do not do any single department function. They have large swaths of open time in their calendar. They keep that space available to put out fires that might occur. When no fires arise, they use the large open swaths of time to: 
Write the next iteration of the company and product vision.
Build relationships with key stakeholders (employees, partners, customers, investors) by reaching out to them to know that the CEO is thinking about them.
These are the functions that only the CEO can do. If she doesn't make time for them, they don't happen, and the company suffers.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
Next, Executive as fireman …
When all the systems are green, you sit and watch.
When one of the systems turns yellow or red, you can step in and operate it yourself (and model for those who will continue to do it after you).  ","CEOs should act like firemen, ready to address crises. In downtime, focus on long-term vision and key relationships for success."

The CEO role is typically thought of as ...
Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company


Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).


Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: investors, customers, partners, employees.


Report to the board and investors


Hire and manage the exec team 


Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.


Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.


Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.


Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.


Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).


Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).


Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.
These are indeed CEO responsibilities. But it doesn't mean that they all need to get done by the CEO. The CEO must ensure that they all get done by someone. And hopefully by someone passionate about that function. Because I posit that only someone who loves a function can be truly good at it, that includes you. If you are not passionate about any of these functions, you will not be good at them.
Most CEOs I coach are product visionaries. They both love and are excellent at:
Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company


Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).

There are three functions that, unfortunately, cannot be outsourced:
Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: employees, partners, customers, and investors.


Report to the board and investors


Hire the exec team
Someone else, however, can do the remainder:
Manage the exec team
 
Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.


Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.


Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.


Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).


Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.


Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).


Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.

In my view, the CEO should only do those functions of the role that she loves to do. The rest she should outsource to someone else who does love them. An easy catch-all is to onboard a COO/President or Chief of Staff (2 min). After 90 days, they will likely be able to do any of the roles that you do not love.


When to fire me as CEO?
If you are completely burned out, or the things that you don't love about the CEO role include people management, hiring, sales, and fundraising (the only thing you love is Product), then its likely time to fire yourself and hire a CEO rather than a CoS or COO. 
Why? Because large customers, investors, and senior executives on your team want to have a direct and ongoing relationship with the person whose title is CEO (i.e., the perceived decision-maker). If you don't want to have those relationships, you have to give the title to the person who will. 
And then name yourself Chairman. Go off and build your ideal life. The joke is that you still get to own all of your equity, that equity will become even more valuable, and you get to build yourself an ideal life.  ","CEO roles involve setting vision, managing relationships, hiring, and overseeing departments. CEOs should outsource tasks they don't love and hire strategically."

Clean Escalate (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDxWPYirGOvs1MxdCkI98U-_7lNjr_b10jclR_D-laQ/edit ,"Clean Escalate (2 min)

""People come to me all the time and complain about others in the company. What do I do?""
Departments need to work collaboratively to get things done. Sales and Marketing must work together to both generate and then close leads. Product and Engineering must work together to understand customer problems and then build the features to solve those problems.
But what if Marketing feels that Sales is squandering the leads that they are giving them? 
What if Product feels that Engineering ignores the product roadmap and builds whatever seems fun to build? 
The Head of Marketing can't hire/fire the Head of Sales. The Head of Product can't hire/fire the Head of Engineering. 
Instead, in frustration, the Head of Marketing will come to you, the CEO, and complain about the Head of Sales and demand that you rectify the problem. This action is a ""dirty escalation."" Escalation because they have escalated the issue up the org chart to you. Dirty because you are only hearing one side of the story.
It is fine to escalate, but the key is to do so cleanly. Clean would be if you, as Apex Manager, received a well-prepared presentation from each side at the same time so that you could make a well-informed decision. 
(An Apex Manager is the manager that has fire/hire authority over both people involved in a disagreement. Often this is the CEO, but not always.)
The following is how Clean Escalation works in practice:
Head of Marketing (HoM) has a problem with the Head of Sales (HoS).


HoM first goes to HoS and clearly states the problem that she is experiencing and her proposed solution. 
If the two agree on a solution, nothing more needs to be done.


If the two cannot agree on a solution, then they agree to do a Clean Escalation to their Apex Manager. Together, they reach out to their Apex Manager jointly and ask for a meeting.


HoM and HoS prepare their positions in writing and submit them to the Apex Manager before the meeting.


At the meeting, all read both documents. Apex Manager asks questions until she feels that she has enough context and then makes a decision. 


It is OK for Apex Manager to ask for a mulligan. 


I.e., ""I need more information."" If this happens, then …
Apex Manager must list out exactly what information she needs and who will collect that information.
The manager sets a new meeting time. Materials are written and submitted in advance. 
At this second meeting, the Apex Manager makes a decision. No more mulligans!
To ensure that clean escalations occur, you, as Apex Manager, must say ""no"" to all dirty escalations. Once you do, your company and your life will become cleaner!",Collaboration is key in departments. Clean Escalation involves both sides presenting solutions to Apex Manager for resolution.

When I was younger, I was a high-level windsurfer and would travel for weeks at a time to Maui to practice my hobby. The harness put a lot of pressure on my back, and I would at some point invariably pinch a nerve causing my back to seize up. I then would go to a chiropractor who would adjust me, and instantly I would be pain-free. The chiropractor would then tell me that I needed ten more weekly sessions. Since I was often only traveling to Maui for several weeks, I could rarely complete any of these follow-up sessions.
Then I moved to San Francisco. I started windsurfing in the Bay and, sure enough, tweaked my back again. I once again found a chiropractor who successfully adjusted my back. But when we finished the session, she did not say that I needed any follow-up visits. I was confused. I asked her about it. She responded: ""Other chiropractors need the money. I don't. I am independently wealthy. I do this because I love fixing people. And you are fixed.""
From that moment on, I only ever wanted to work with people who do what they do for love, not money. They're hard to find. But they exist. 
I have noticed that there is one thing common among them: They rarely seek work. Meaning, they focus their time on practicing their craft, not interviewing for jobs. 
If you are looking for a coach, you can take one of two approaches:
Get several names of potential coaches, and invite them in to interview. Most will be willing to, and from that pool, you will be able to choose. Know, though, that the best of the best likely won’t be willing to participate in such a process.  Or, 


Spend the same amount of time you would spend interviewing, and instead spend it: 


Finding who is considered to be the best coach.


Trying to convince that person to coach you. These nuggets will help: 


Coaches are essentially teachers, so they love people eager to learn, experiment, and do. Show that you are an enthusiastic student by reading their materials in advance.


See Fundraising- The Relationship Method and Selling. The principles work on coaches as well.
Both will take a similar amount of time. I believe that #2 yields a far better result.","High-level windsurfer's experience with chiropractors leads to seeking coaches who work for passion, not money. Advice on finding one."

The book Trillion Dollar Coach describes the role that Bill Campbell played at Google. He was a shadow manager to the exec team. Bi-weekly, he met 1-1 with each exec team member, where they each shared with him their true frustrations. He then attended the weekly exec team meeting and made sure that all of the deepest, darkest issues that people had shared with him surfaced just as transparently to the group, forcing them to deal with them and find a resolution.
This is an incredibly valuable role. As CEO, you can play this role if you enjoy it. But if you don't, then hire someone to do it. This can be a coach or your Chief of Staff. It's not a complicated role to play. It just requires being willing to ask probing questions and fearlessness to surface the juiciest topic (the ""elephant in the room"") in the group meeting.
Chris Mansi of Viz.ai hired a coach to do this and had a great experience. Because of that, I now recommend it to all CEOs that I coach. 
Chris Mansi of Viz.ai:
I definitely recommend having a coach for the entire exec team - the same person coaching them as a team and 1:1. We used the conscious leadership group, and it's been amazing. 
Benefits are
- you develop a shared language that you can use to move faster without getting in your way
- more trust and transparency, esp at times of stress when it could be easy to ""be professional"" and not discuss an issue
- exec team feel cared for and invested in
It will likely work so well at the exec team level that you will want to hire such a person for each big team.

"Comms, Internal:  Announcing traumatic events (5 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HaKYEnw4ec--oL_vPKCRK8ognGbzkc8BzfA6_aIpfo/edit ,"Comms, Internal:  Announcing traumatic events
Whether you let go of a single senior executive or lay off 30% of the company, it is a trauma to the organization. Anytime a ""negative"" occurrence like this happens, those that remain naturally ask themselves the question, ""Am I next?"" and they feel fear. This anxiety is not motivating but instead causes people to spend time and energy trying to figure out what is going on (talking to each other about this), creating other options (interviewing with other companies), etc. If the fear is allowed to fester, many will actually leave to get to a place of stability. All of this creates a tremendous downward pull on productivity. Therefore, your primary goal should be to minimize the feeling of fear in the organization.
And the best way to minimize fear is to ... acknowledge it! 
First, know that any trauma, whether small or large, takes time for the organization to heal from. 
Usually 2-3 months. And if a new trauma occurs before the organization has had time to heal from the last one fully, then organizational PTSD may well set in. 
Many CEOs ask: ""If I know that I will need to let go many people, is it better for me to drip out the terminations through rolling performance reviews, or should I terminate all at once?"" The answer from me is an unequivocal ""all at once."" Make it one trauma and begin the healing process, rather than a never-ending series of concussions from which the org cannot heal.
Second, know that when a traumatic event happens, a moment of trust or distrust happens. If you try to hide the fact that it occurred (make no announcement) or blame the people leaving, then the remainder of the org will lose trust in you. If, however, you announce the trauma to all, take responsibility for the fact that these people are leaving (i.e., ""I hired too many people too fast""), and put real time and effort into helping every terminated employee land a fantastic next job, then the org will gain significant trust in you.
Third, when the org does feel fear (as it will when you announce the RIF), the best way that I know to alleviate it is:
The first time a person learns that they are being let go, it is in a 1-1.  (Therefore schedule many 1-1s back to back with those being let go.  It is OK for each of these meetings to last only 10 minutes, and therefore to schedule them every 15 minutes.)  This is step 1.
In these 1-1s, share that you will schedule a longer follow-up where
They will sign their offboarding documents and receive their severance pay.
You will be their agent in finding their next job, if they are open to your help.  See Firing Well (updated) for the details.
Make sure that all of the remaining team members (the Stay Team) have the same information … a thorough announcement in an All Hands Meeting after the termination 1-1s have occurred.


Ensure that each person can vent their emotions … a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of learning about the trauma.  Cause each remaining team member to have a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of the All Hands Meeting.


During this 1-1, the manager should ask the team member to share their feelings and thoughts. The manager should not seek to defend or justify the company's actions but rather hear and acknowledge the team member's thoughts. 


If the team member is unwilling to share anything juicy, the manager can say, ""I imagine you are thinking …"" and then supply a juicy thought that the team member might plausibly be thinking (i.e., ""our CEO is a cold bastard""). Exaggerate the thought to the negative. If you do, it implicity permits the team member to express their less radical views. The team member will usually respond: ""Yeah, something like that, but not that strong."" or ""Not that, but what I am thinking is …."" 


Once the team member expresses their thought, the manager can show that they have heard by simply saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" and then summarizing what the team member said. Do this until the team member states, ""That's right."" Then the team member will feel heard, and this will dissipate much of their anger and fear. 
For further detail, read Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min)
Fourth, do not have the terminated employees remain at the company any longer than is absolutely necessary. If you are terminating them for cause, they will often be bitter and toxic during these post-termination days. If they were terminated because of a layoff, they will remind everyone of their sadness at their departure. Either way, it is healthier to start fresh with the new team as soon as possible. 
Fifth, word about the termination will likely spread. If it is newsworthy, a reporter will write about it and use it as proof that your company is failing. If you want to get ahead of this story, write it yourself and publish it before anyone else can write about it. Make it juicy enough that any other hit piece will be a darker shade of grey than what you wrote, and therefore not new enough to be worth writing. 
Lastly, the exact timing of making the announcement has several possible paths, each with its plus and minuses. I will discuss two here:
1. Managers announce the terminations in 1-1s before the AHM for the “stay team.”
Plus: 
The first time a terminated employee learns of the termination, they get 1-1 attention from their manager.
The first-time non-terminated employees attend an AHM; you assure them that they are part of the go-forward team.
Minus: 
The entire team does not have the same information at the same time.
2. An AHM happens first. You inform everyone of the ""why"" of the terminations. You invite those who are terminated to a 1-1 in the morning. A second AHM happens in the afternoon for the “stay team.”
Plus: 
The entire team has the same information at the same time.
Minus: 
If you announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., who has a 1-1 already scheduled in the morning), they will likely express their sadness and anger to their teammates while they await the 1-1.
If you do not announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., Managers come and get the next terminated person for a 1-1), then all will fear during the morning hours, not knowing if they will be next.
There is no correct answer between these paths. Just be aware of the Plus and Minus of each. 
Here, therefore, is my preferred timeline:
Preparation.  These steps to happen very close together: 
The executive team decides broad strokes of who they will terminate. 
Ask managers to give specific recommendations.
The executive team makes the final list. 
Managers set up 1-1s with all of their stay team members for Day 2. 
Schedule the terminations for the morning of Day 1. 
Schedule All Hands meetings for those who are staying for the afternoon of Day One.


These next steps are all to happen back-to-back in a total of 1-3 days: 
Day 0: Inform all managers who will be let go.
Day 1: 
All Hands Meeting 
State what you are doing
State why you are doing it
State that those with 1-1s in the morning are being let go, those in the afternoon are remaining.
Thank every person for their service, and assure them that you will spend real time making sure that they land softly … and then do it! 
Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling 
""You may well be thinking … 
Our CEO is a cold bastard.
This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary.""
If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.


Every manager meets 1-1 with every team member who is leaving. 
The manager commits to spending real-time helping them find their next role (and must follow through on this).
The manager listens to and acknowledges the team member's feelings and thoughts.
Create an alumni Slack channel. 
If you don't do it, they will. And you won't like the results if they create it on their own. 
Be in the channel and actively help alumni solve their problems.


All Hands Meeting with all of the remaining team to announce what is happening. 
State what you are doing
State why you are doing it
Express deep gratitude for all that has been done by both those that are leaving and those that remain.
Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling 
""You may well be thinking … 
Am I next?
Our CEO is a cold bastard.
This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary.""
If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.
State the go-forward Vision for the company. Who is the new customer, what is their problem, and how will you solve it.
 
Publish your article about the layoffs on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. 

Day 2, every manager meets 1-1 with all the remaining team members to vent their feelings and thoughts in the afternoon.

Reading this, if you are the CEO, you are likely feeling fear, especially if you have never done a layoff before. You may be thinking the following: 
""The press is going to write that we are failing."" 
""I can't bear to let all these people go who are really good and were so hard to recruit. It will take me so much effort to rehire their equal again later."" 
""Some of these people are single mothers with small children. I will be putting them out on the street.""
""They will hate me.""
All of these are legitimate thoughts. Their intent is positive … to keep you safe. But know that they are likely exaggerations. The reality is possible that:
If you write your press, the story will be over.
When you get leaner, the company will operate even more efficiently. And then when you do rehire, you will rehire even better people.
Those who are in dire economic circumstances, you will help to land a great position. And they may well be even better off then.
If you are transparent, take responsibility for the situation, and genuinely help each laid-off person find a new position, then you will likely be respected and appreciated.
Remember that Jack Welch is remembered as the greatest CEO of all time. And he was a one-trick pony. All he did was let go of the bottom 10% of GE each year and overcompensate the top 20%. That's it. Brutal, but highly effective.
You can remove the brutality by putting real effort into helping those let go find a soft landing. ","Announcing traumatic events at work is crucial. Acknowledge fear, provide support, and ensure transparency to minimize negative impact."
Compensation (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnMXBO0uum5E5x6QlMcbcdOIRightwdy73DzRerKTdI/edit# ,"Compensation (3 min)
How much compensation do you offer new team members? How much cash and equity?
My preferred method is to:
Discover the market compensation for the position (role and seniority). There are plenty of online compensation studies that show this. Market compensation is whatever a big company (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) pays for this position.


Discover the amount of cash that the new team member would need to live comfortably (housing, food, transportation, child expenses, etc.).
It is up to the startup to match the market compensation level, not in cash as the larger companies do, but rather in a much lesser amount of cash (no less than the amount needed to live comfortably), plus equity to bridge the difference. 
Here is an example to show how to calculate the equity portion. Let's say the position is a Level 3 Engineer who is paid $300,000 in total compensation at Google. The team member requires $120,000 in cash to live comfortably and invests the remainder in startup equity. To calculate the amount of equity take the difference between market and cash ($300,000-$120,000=$180,000) and multiplying it by four years ($180,000 x 4 = $720,000). Then divide this amount by a factor somewhere between 1 and 2, which represents a very conservative estimate of the increase in value of the equity over four years. A 1 represents no expected increase in value. A 2 represents a 2x expected increase in value. If 1.5 were used (which is the most common factor used), the final amount would be $720,000 / 1.5 = $480,000. So grant this amount in options; however much equity it purchases at the company's current valuation—the options vest over four years.
I prefer to make an offer that allows the new team member to choose how much they want to invest in the startup equity at three different levels. The lowest cash level would be the level needed to live comfortably. 
Here's an example in which the company is currently worth $50mm. The company will likely need to do another major financing round, and optional pool refreshes before it reaches maturity, an expected 50% dilution to the current cap table. A $1 billion eventual value of the company would result in a 10x increase in the equity value. (20x increase in company value x 50% dilution = 10x increase in equity value.)
The three options would be:

 
Annual Cash
Equity Worth
Expected Value at $1 billion company valuation
1
$120,000
$480,000
$4,800,000
2
$140,000
$426,666
$4,266,666
3
$160,000
$361,333
$3,613,333


The hope is that the new team member believes so fully in the company (and the power of the asymmetric bet) that they choose one of the two higher equity offers. This equity is thus an investment that the team member is making in the company. And with a huge advantage: The employee makes the investment with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power.
","Offer compensation based on market rates, covering living expenses in cash and the rest in equity to bridge the difference."
Compensation: CEO refresh,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkMfwxNO8EGpTrSxwbye-XRqRIjdxMSjeeco6IXHQgc/edit ,"Compensation: CEO refresh

Yes, there is such a thing. Investors hate it.  But in the end, they grant it.  Because it’s market.  And their alternative is a terrible one.

On the one hand, investors want you to feel like a major owner already and not need any more ownership to incent you.

On the other hand, if the company had to hire a CEO, they would likely need to make a 4-year grant of 3-10% of the company, depending on its size.  And with that hire would come significant risk, because a significant % of hired gun CEOs fail.  Would the board rather retain you at 60% of this amount?  If you are performing, then “Yes, without a doubt.”

But don’t ask for this amount yourself.  For many board members, especially less experienced ones, they will feel offended by this ask. Some very offended.  (More senior board members have already been through this a few times, and are already over it.)

Better to hire a good compensation firm like Semler Brossy  (Todd Sirras tsirras@semlerbrossy.com), Compensia or Alpine Rewards (formerly Radford Partners) to present the market data.  And then have someone represent you in the negotiation.  Let the representative be the bad cop.  The company should pay for both the market comp data and your representation, as those are legitimate corporate expenses.

The charge from the comp consultant will be about $100,000.  Each of your venture investors already has the data of what their portfolio CEO refreshes are.  If you want to save the $100,000, and trust your investors to share with you what the market data really is, you can simply ask them what their portfolio CEOs are getting.  If you have any doubt at all that they will share with you the real information, use an external consultant.

As of late 2020, the market for CEO refresh seemed to be 3% with 4 year-vesting.

As of early 2023, a new and interesting option has appeared:  
5% total over 4 years.  But 25% granted each year for 4 years.  
So, in year 1 a grant of 1.25% is given with a 4 year vest.  
In year 2, another grant of 1.25% is given with a 4 year vest.  
Etc.

Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzF-otDuBWKC2GShJKcFsxCyabK1V3skQwCMU89tDmY/edit# ,"Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min)

Interpersonal conflict arises often. And almost always it is due to people:
Not fully sharing their feelings and thoughts.
Not feeling heard. 
There is a laughably simple method for solving this issue. Stephen Covey shared the technique in his iconic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change. Michael Rosenberg codified it in Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life. And Chris Voss showed its effectiveness in his excellent Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It. I recommend reading all three of these books to get fully immersed in their techniques, but here is the thousand-foot view:
When people distrust or dislike each other, usually, it is because they don't feel heard. For me to respect you, I don't need for you to agree with me. But I do need for you to listen to what I have to say. When I tell you my perspective (which I, of course, believe to be right) and you aren't immediately convinced, I assume you didn't hear or understand what I said. If you start sharing your perspective, I will be uncompelled and unwilling to truly listen because you haven't been willing to consider mine. And the cycle spirals downward to distrust and dislike.
There is a simple fix. You only need to prove to me that you have ""heard"" me. And to do that, you only need to repeat back what I've said in summary form by saying ""I think I heard you say …"" until I say, ""That's right!"" Then I will feel heard. I will now be open to hearing what you have to say. 
(Here is an experiment that proves this principle. The next time you encounter a person repeating themselves, stop them and ask if you can state back what they've already said. They will say ""yes."" You then summarize what they've said and ask if you got it right. If they say ""yes"" again, then watch to see if they continue to repeat themselves. They will not.)
To resolve conflict, you only need to get each person to state their deepest, darkest thoughts and then prove that each has heard what the other has said. This action can be done verbally or in writing. I far prefer the written method as it takes about ⅓ the time, requires almost no facilitation (i.e., it's easy to stay on the script), and the action items that come out of it are impeccable agreements.
If you are the facilitator, here's how it works (the written method):
Step 1: Ask each person to write down their deepest thoughts about the other person.
Participants, please open up a Doc. Please give me (the facilitator) access, but do not give access to the other person yet. 


On the doc, write five categories: 
Anger (present)
Fear (future)
Sadness (past)
Joy (present and past)
Excitement (future)


In every significant relationship, we have feelings of Anger, Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement. When you think about the other person and focus on the anger you feel, what thoughts come to mind? Please write those thoughts in the following way: 
Feeling: Anger
Story: The thought that I had was …. 
(By framing this as a thought or story in your head, it takes away the sting of judgment, because you are sharing that this is just a thought that you have, not the absolute truth.)
Request: Please do or say …. 
(An action that the other can take to address this situation entirely.)


Here is an example: 
Feeling: Anger 
Story: I thought that you purposely ignored me and thus were really saying ""Screw you!"" to me.
Request: From now on, when you walk by me, please say ""hello.""


As the facilitator, look at both docs and make sure that the participants fill them out correctly. Make sure that requests are explicit and that the participants can take verifiable actions.
If one or both are reluctant to say anything, which is often the case, you supply the thoughts you might have if you were in their shoes. Be dramatic. Become an actor. Get into the role. State the thoughts as explicitly as they would appear in your mind. Use swear words.
The person will start to guide you. They are likely to say: ""That's close, but not quite it. The thoughts I have are more like …"" When they slow down or don't seem willing to go further, again state the thoughts for them. Each time you do so, it allows them to go further. Do this until each person has written down their raw, unvarnished thoughts around anger toward the other. Once they get that right, they can usually get through Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement on their own.


Now ask each participant to cut and paste the Joy and Excitement sections to the top of the doc. For the person sharing their emotions and thoughts, it is hard to feel Joy and Excitement until they have first written down their thoughts around Anger and Fear. But when the recipient reads the doc, it is best to see how the sharer actually has positive thoughts about the recipient. This action validates the relationship and motivates the recipient to do what is needed to repair that relationship. Therefore, the recipient needs to read the thoughts around Joy and Excitement first.
Step 2: Person A (with less power in the relationship) shares access to their doc with Person B.
Person A says out loud her stories around Joy and Excitement to Person B. Person B should simply say ""thank you"" to Person A when she hears these thoughts.


Person B then reads through Person A’s stories around Sadness, Fear or Anger to Person B.   She picks the one the feels biggest, and asks Person A to say that one out loud.


Person B then makes Person A feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).  This is the key step!!
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 
Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  If they share more, go back to step a.
Repeat the above process until Person A says “No, that’s it.”
You, the facilitator, then follow this script:


The facilitator asks Person B: ""Do you want to make Person A feel Anger and have these thoughts?"" 
Person B: ""No."" 
If the answer is ""yes,"" then the two should not be in a relationship together. That means that one will likely need to be let go from the organization. Regardless of seniority, the person to be let go should usually be the person who wants the other to feel anger. That person will likely create toxic relationships with others and eventually will have to leave the company anyway.


Facilitator to Person A: ""What request do you have of Person B?"" 
Person A: ""Please do the following: ….""


If Person B agrees, have Person B write down the action item (with their initials and due date) just below the fact/judgment of Person A.
The goal is to co-create a plan so that misunderstanding and anger do not enter the relationship again. Person A goes first. Person B adds their thoughts. They go back and forth until they have agreed on a written plan.
Verbal agreements are not impeccable. We all understand words a little bit differently. To make this agreement impeccable, one of the participants writes down the plan, and the other adds their initials and a ""+1"" to note their agreement. 
Facilitator to Person A: ""Do you feel heard? Do you feel that Person B wants to have a positive relationship with you?""
Person A: ""Yes.""
If the answer is ""no,"" get curious and find out why. Repeat the steps above until the answer is ""yes.""
Do not move on to a second Anger item yet.
Step 3: Person B shares access to their doc with Person A.
Repeat the same script as in Step 2. 
Now both Person A and Person B have:
affirmed that they want to be in a positive relationship with each other.
accepted the feedback and created an action item to resolve it.
Step 4: When the ""ah-ha"" moment of understanding occurs, seal it with a physical connection: a handshake, a high-five, a hug.
When Step 3 is complete, there will usually be a moment of understanding and compassion for each other. When this moment occurs, seal it with a physical connection. If the two have hugged in the past, ask them to do so again now. If the most they have done in the past is shake hands or high-five, then ask them to do that now. This physical connection symbolizes the new understanding and puts a capstone on the event.
Step 5: Ask each person for feedback on the process.
What did you like that I (as facilitator) did? 


What did you wish that I had done differently?
Step 6: Set a meeting for 1-2 weeks out between Person A, Person B, and the Facilitator. 
If the first meeting was rocky, schedule a 1-1 with each participant before the second group meeting. During these 1-1s, help each person share their deepest thoughts, stay on script and view the feedback they receive as a gift.


At the second group meeting, confirm that both Person A and B have completed their action items. This step will prove to each other that there is a genuine desire for a positive relationship.


Do Steps 2-4 on the remainder of issues identified under Anger and Fear for each person.
In my experience, when two people, who previously hated each other, have shared their thoughts (and been heard) around all five of the basic emotions they feel toward the other, the two create an understanding and respect for each other even if they still do not agree with the others' positions. Please let me know if you experience something different.

Conscious Leadership is about being more interested in learning than being right. When our egos make us afraid to be wrong, that fear leads us to defend our ideas at all costs and work hard to convince others that we are right—often with anger. Conscious Leadership is about:
Recognizing when these emotions (fear, anger, sadness) have gripped our thought processes.
Releasing these emotions and shifting back to a state of curiosity where we are receptive to all ideas and creativity, even if they seem to contradict our own. It is in a state of playful curiosity that we achieve exquisite solutions.
Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman, and Kaley Warner Klemp explain this concept thoroughly in their book The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership.
The challenge, of course, is to shift from wanting to be right to wanting to learn. Here are some videos that help with that shift.

Empathy
Spiritual teacher and author David Deida goes one step further and teaches that empathy is the key to success. To truly feel the feelings of those around you—customers, investors, and team members alike—you must get very curious about their situations and then really imagine yourself in their shoes. If you do this, people will sense it and immediately trust and like you because they will feel that you care about them and understand their circumstances. They'll trust you to lead them because they know you'll truly consider their interests in your guidance.
Joy vs. Fear
When people start diving into the Conscious Leadership work, they quickly lose their fear. And just as quickly, they realize that fear was their primary motivator—fear of failure, fear of letting people down. Once fear is gone, their life becomes much better, but their business suffers. 
If you find yourself in this situation, keep pushing forward with the Conscious Leadership work quickly to get to a place where you are motivated by joy. Joy is an even better motivator than fear, so your business will thrive. And your life will be amazing! Then you will have the best of all worlds.
Summary
Many CEOs that I coach have deeply embraced the principles of Conscious Leadership. Alex MacCaw, founder and CEO of Clearbit, is one of them. He has written this excellent summary of the Conscious Leadership principles, found in Appendix A.
","Conscious Leadership prioritizes learning over being right, shifting from fear to curiosity, empathy, and joy for success and growth."

Unconscious Listening
We listen unconsciously most of the time - with an agenda or motive that keeps us from really listening. We listen to...

Fix - Listen while attempting to fix their problem for them, responding only with solutions. 
Diagnose - Analyze the circumstances, offer hypotheses, and ask questions to clarify your theories. 
Defend - Listen for how the person has misperceived the situation and respond with reframing.
Calm - Listen for how the person needs to feel relaxed and try to console them. 
Debate - Listen with skepticism and respond with devil's advocacy. 
Correct - Listen for where the person is incorrect, and respond with corrections, improvements, and/or criticism


Conscious Listening
Conscious Listening happens when the listener is aware of what's occurring at the moment for themselves and with the person they're listening to, without any alternate motives. This kind of Listening supports genuine transformation and honors the intelligence of the head, heart, and gut.

HEAD
What is the mental content within the message - the words, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs? (Facts and Stories)

HEART
What is the emotional content that is fueling the expression - the five core emotions are anger, sadness, fear, joy, and excitement? (Feelings)

GUT (For Advanced Listeners)
What is the base desire behind the content - what is wanted, longed for, or needed? (Desires)

Conscious + Active Listening

I hear you saying that… (facts), and you have a story/thought that… (story). It sounds like you feel... (feelings) and you really want... (desires).
Did I get that right?
Is there more?

Note: In practice, I often simply share back the story/thought + feelings. I hear you saying that… (story/thought), and it sounds like you're feeling... (feeling). 

Signs that someone is being consciously listened to:
More color in the face 
More flow of feeling and/or a burst of energy 
An exhale or relaxation of breath 
A more natural or relaxed pace in the conversation","Unconscious listening involves fixing, diagnosing, defending, calming, debating, and correcting. Conscious listening involves awareness of mental, emotional, and desire content."

Video of Emilie Choi (Coinbase President and COO) explaining RAPIDs and Biz Ops (20 min)
Getting Buy-In 
One of the core challenges in leadership is how to get your team to buy into a decision. It's often easy to decide, but it can be much harder to get your team to invest emotionally in that decision. 
You create buy-in when you make people feel they are part of the decision and that their input contributes to the outcome. The more influence they feel towards the outcome, the more invested they will be in the result.
Broadly, there are three ways to make a decision. Each has a different time requirement and creates different levels of buy-in. There are no free lunches here; unfortunately—the method that creates the most buy-in also takes the most time.
The methods are:
Method 1: Decision-Maker (see Type 1 vs. Type 2 below) makes the decision, announces it to the team, and answers questions.
Pro: Takes very little time.
Con: Creates minimal buy-in from the team and ignores benefits from their collective knowledge and experience. 
Method 2: Decision-Maker (or assigns someone) fosters a collaborative environment with the team. This process entails creating a written straw man (a hypothetical answer designed to inspire discussion), sharing it with the team, inviting the team to give feedback (written and verbal), facilitating group discussion, making everyone feel heard by repeating their comments, and coming to a decision.
Pro: Creates more buy-in and gets some minimal benefit from the collective wisdom of the team.
Con: Takes more time.
Method 3: Decision-Maker invites the team to meet and discuss the dilemma from scratch with no straw man using Brainstorming, structured (1min). Team shares ideas. Decision-maker repeats everyone's ideas until they feel heard. She shares her thoughts last because hers is the loudest voice in the room.
Decision-Maker then asynchronously creates her strawman (see #2 above) and shares it with the group for feedback. Decision-maker then makes the decision. Note: this is not a consensus decision. The decision-Maker creates the buy-in and confirms that she hears all ideas but ultimately does not accommodate all ideas.
Pro: Creates the most buy-in and gets a lot of benefit from the team's collective wisdom.
Con: Takes the most time.
Not surprisingly, the most significant benefits require the most work. If you want more buy-in and a better decision, you need to take more time making the decision.
So, which method should you use? It depends on the significance of the decision and the importance of the team's buy-in. For low-impact issues (e.g., the venue for the holiday party), Method 1 is sufficient. For major, core issues (e.g., Company 10-Year Vision, Company Goals, Product Roadmap), Method 3 is necessary. For everything in between (the vast majority of important decisions), Method 2 is optimal.
Issues and Proposed Solutions
Team members will often want to bring up an issue and discuss it verbally. This step is inefficient (listening takes longer than reading) and ineffective (only forward people speak up and get heard).
Instead, require that anyone who presents an issue at a team meeting do so in writing. The write-up should include both a detailed description of the Issue as well as their Proposed Solution. 
(I also like to include a section on “What I did to create this issue” just after the Issue description and before my Proposed Solution.  This makes others not feel blamed, and also usually points out a way that I can solve the issue on my own by unwinding the steps that I took to create it.)
The proposer may say, ""I don't know the answer."" It doesn't matter. Even if they only have 10% confidence in their answer, they should guess that their answer is the right one. And they should phrase the Proposed Solution in very bold, directive terms. (""Do this …."") This step may seem aggressive but creates a flag in the sand, which generates a highly productive discussion and quicker decision-time, which ultimately is more important than appearing to be humble.
I recommend that the team present all Issues and Proposed Solutions at the weekly Team Meeting. Allow up to 5 minutes of discussion for each tactical (short-term) Proposed Solution and as much as 20 minutes for each strategic (long-term) Proposed Solution. If the Decision-Maker feels that they have enough context to decide in that time, great. The decision-maker turns the Solution into a Next Action with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and Due Date.
If not, DO NOT spend more time talking about the Issue. Instead, turn to the RAPID framework described below.

IPS Flow Chart
Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions
In his iconic 2016 Shareholder Letter, Amazon's Jeff Bezos introduced us to light-weight, distributed decision-making. He wrote:
""Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren't like that – they are changeable, reversible – they're two-way doors. If you've made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. 
As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We'll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.""
Each time there is a decision to be made, rate it as Type 1 or Type 2. If Type 2, allow one of your reports to be the D (Decision-Maker in the RAPID process). Your report will make a faster decision, they will get the chance to exercise their decision-making muscle, and you will have the opportunity to gain confidence in their ability to make decisions well.
And note that, as Mike Vernal, Partner at Sequoia and former VP of Platform at Facebook, shared with me: ""Decisions are almost never Type 1.""

A team has become too large to get all the needed voices in one room
A team cannot reach a consensus within 5-20 minutes of discussion
It is called RAPID. Here is an example of a RAPID. In this process:
The identifier of an issue or decision writes the following: 
The Issue
The Proposed Solution
The list of people required to make and implement the decision: 
R (Recommend) = the one who first proposed the Issue and Solution
A (Agree) = Include colleague whose input is vital to the decision 
This group is usually Legal, who are ensuring that no one is breaking the law!
P (Perform) = those people who will have to enact any decision and, therefore, should contribute
I (Input) = those people whose input is worth considering
D (Decide) = the one who will make the decision 
(See section below for an explanation of this Amazon modification.) 
If Type 1, this should be the CEO.
If Type 2, this should be someone other than the CEO.
Create a section on the document for each person to write their comments.
The R then reaches out to all the As, Ps, and Is to solicit their input. Once this input is received, the document is ready to be reviewed by the D.
The R schedules a Decision Meeting and invites the D, As, Is, and Ps. 
If the issue is urgent, the R schedules this Decision Meeting as soon as it needs to be.
If the issue is non-urgent, the R can use the next Team Meeting as the Decision Meeting. (This option is much more efficient and is best when the issue is non-urgent.)
At the Decision Meeting, the D reads through the document and asks any questions. If the participants can answer her questions in 5 minutes, she decides. If the team cannot answer in 5 minutes, she asks for another round of written responses on the document to answer her questions. At the next Team Meeting, she reviews these responses and decides.
Once the D decides, she writes up the Decision (or asks the R to do so) and all the Next Actions (each with a DRI and Due Date). The D then publishes this decision to the company.
Once a company starts this process, it is helpful to track all the RAPIDs that are in process and collect feedback on how to improve the process. For each of these, I recommend a doc:
Create a Sheet to track each RAPID (with a link to the RAPID document), which R and D are responsible for, when the Decision Meeting will take (or has taken) place, and finally, when the team completes all the Next Actions.


Create a Doc for Feedback (Like/Wish That) on the RAPID process. After each Decision Meeting, ask the participants to write their feedback until the process is working smoothly.


Decision-maker matrix

Paul Meister, former Chief of Staff at BioRender, created this helpful matrix to help any team decide who the appropriate decision-maker should be in any given situation.  He has generously agreed to share his matrix with the world.

Decision-making:  separate decision from implementation (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VkFRbhDTeU0nBEiot8CXiK37UUEZp0D-sT4-IN02Hs/edit ,"Decision-making:  separate decision from implementation (1 min)
(Wei Deng of Clipboard Health shared this rubrik with me.  It’s excellent.)

When we have a difficult decision to make, we often feel lost and confused.  As we imagine the possible answers, none “feel good”.  We can solicit feedback and opinions from others (and this can identify many different possible answers), but we still may not “know” what to do.

In this situation, we are often co-mingling the decision and the implementation.  The decision itself is often clear, but the implementation likely feels painful.  When we think of both together, our feeling of fear about the implementation infects our view of the decision.

To separate the two:


Answer “Who do we serve primarily?”


If you are involved in a company, this is your customer.
If you are involved in a fund, this is both the CEOs that you invest in and the LPs that invest in you.
If you are involved in government, this is the citizens you serve.
If you are involved in a family, this is the members of your family (including you).


Then ask yourself “What is in the best interest of the person we serve primarily?” 


This answer is the correct decision. Write it down.


Now think of the implementation.  It will likely be difficult and painful to implement as you will perceive that it causes injury to others and yourself.  You have two possible routes.


Simply implement without worrying about the injury that it causes, or


Look at the injury that it causes to you and others.


Reach out to those other people and discover what really matters to them.  Then think of ways to help them achieve that. 


With a thought partner, or on your own, think of what really matters to you.  Think of ways to achieve that.


… now implement.

If this process makes sense logically, but you are finding it difficult to follow in practice, ask a co-worker, spouse or friend to be your thought partner.  Share this doc with them.  They will likely be able to walk you through the process successfully.  

Why?  Because they are not in fear about the pain of implementation.  Only you are.

","Separate decision from implementation by focusing on serving others' best interests, then addressing the potential pain of implementation with empathy."
Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pGR1sc5IlFXxXE9ve_RrvE1MVWpoYR7CxSyPL6wHQk/edit ,"Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min)


“I have decided to hire a CRO and layer my VP of Sales.  Now I need to tell my VP of Sales.  He will likely be devastated.  But I want him to stay, as he does a fine job on the sales side, just not on the marketing side.  How do I deliver the message without causing him to leave?”

There will always come a moment when you have to deliver news that the recipient will not like.  It will be a difficult conversation.  Here’s how to have it …

First, prepare by reading the Giving Feedback section in Feedback.  

Second, ask if the person is available to talk.

“I’d like to talk to you Sam.  Is now a good time?”    If not, ask “When would be a good time?”
This conversation should happen synchronously (in person, or on a video or audio call), not asynchronously.   It’s important to see or hear the person’s emotional reaction to your message. 

Third, when you begin the meeting, start by letting the person know that this will be a difficult conversation.

“This is going to be a difficult conversation.  You are likely going to feel some combination of anger, fear and sadness.”

Why?  Because the times when we go into deepest fear and anger are when we are surprised.  But if we get a warning that something negative is about to occur, we can mentally prepare just a little bit, and then the surprise and the feelings of fear and anger are not nearly as large.

Fourth, clearly state the difficult thing.


“I am going to hire a CRO and will ask you to report to them.”

Do not lead up to this.  Get the punchline out first so that the person knows that this decision has already been made, and does not try to lobby you.  This is … ripping the band-aid off in one stroke.

Fifth, briefly explain why.

“I am doing this because our customers need … “

This should not be a long explanation.  Just 2-3 bullet points.  At this point, the person listening has likely gone into some version of fear, anger or sadness.  Their brain is not fully functioning, so they have a limited capacity to hear and process.  Therefore, keep it short.

Sixth, ask them for their thoughts and feelings.  

“I imagine that you are likely feeling anger, fear or sadness.  I’d like to know your feelings and thoughts.  Are you open to sharing them with me?”

The person will likely have lots of feelings and thoughts.  Stating those thoughts will allow the person to release them just a bit. 

Seventh, whatever they say, make them feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).

“I think I heard you say ….  Am I close?”

You do not need to act on their thoughts, just let them know that you understand their thoughts.  That’s all.  This will allow the person to let go of some of their harsher feelings.  Not entirely.  But enough that they likely won’t act rashly.  



Eighth, if you are able to help the person achieve what they truly want (ie- find another great job, etc), do so.

That’s it.

"Do I need a Coach, Mentor, Consultant or Cheerleader? (By Celine Teoh) (3 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6NiD4XEIQDlHREukTZBVquUoLXJKxxFQHy_ZryjHQU/edit?usp=sharing ,"Do I need a Coach, Mentor, Consultant or Cheerleader? (3 minutes)

What is the difference between a coach, consultant, mentor, (or cheerleader)?

Coaches ask challenging questions to help you discover the answer 
They unleash your potential to maximize your performance
They offer: 
A confidential and judgment-free zone where you can broaden your thinking and develop transformational insights
Options in the form of frameworks and tools you can use to make smarter, better decisions
You’re in control: you choose what actions to take to move forward
Consultants/Advisors ask questions up front to frame the problem. They focus on getting you the answer: they have it, or will find it for you
They are experts in their fields and provide professional, technical advice on a well-defined problem
Mentors share their experiences
They have “been in your shoes”, and can share knowledge, insights, and guidance that is applicable to your path
Cheerleaders just support you
They believe you have the answer
They don’t question you

It’s important for you as a leader to have - and embody - all four of these roles in your life!

But I just want someone to tell me what to do!
At Mochary Method, we largely play more of the coach role. Occasionally, when appropriate, we can “take off the Coaching hat” and put on the Mentor, Consultant, or Cheerleader hat.

Our clients are the best in their fields, and the experts in their businesses — often in an area where they are forging new paths. As your coach and thinking partner, we’ll help you combine prior knowledge and experience with new insights, tools and skills to find solutions and the path forward.



How is coaching different from therapy?
Many of our clients have therapists AND coaches and see the value in both.





Coaching is ARCHITECTURE
Forward-looking
Designing the future, imagining possibilities
Building things 
Focused on insight and action
Helps us move into high performance








Therapy is ARCHEOLOGY
Backward-looking
Digging and analyzing
Focused on understanding 	and fixing
Helps us move out of 		dysfunction

Action:
Think about who fills these roles for you: Coach, Mentor, Consultant, Cheerleader. Licensed therapist, if needed
Do you have any blanks? Sometimes one person can fill multiple roles (Not therapists though, who fill a very specific need)
If you don’t have a coach, we recommend getting one. Feel free to reach out to any of the Mochary Method Coaches, or look into Matt’s Coach Recommendations
Also: Notice what roles you play for your team. What do you gravitate towards? What role should you step more into?","Differentiate between coaches, consultants, mentors, and cheerleaders. Coaches challenge, consultants advise, mentors share experiences, and cheerleaders offer support."

About the authors
Sid Sijbrandij is the founder and CEO of Gitlab, the largest ""intentionally remote"" company in the world by team members: over 1500 as of October 2021. Sid has spent many years perfecting the art of running an all-remote company and would like to share his learnings with the world.
Matt Mochary is the coach to many of the tech world's top CEOs (eBay, Reddit, Coinbase, Brex) and investors (Sequoia, Benchmark), including several intentionally remote companies (Gitlab, Mattermost). He has directly seen the benefits of all remote and believes that ""remote done right"" beats a hybrid, and likely an all-in-person, structure every time. 
This book, therefore, is about how to do remote right, at least in the minds of Sid and Matt.
Here is how Sid defines the stages of remote.
Introduction
In March 2020, the emerging pandemic forced the entire world to go all remote with no warning or time to prepare. Despite the utter lack of planning, most companies discovered that productivity didn't suffer. In many cases, it increased. 
But there were cracks. Parents of young children felt the stress of not having a quiet space to take work video calls. Those who lived alone felt the mental pain of being isolated for weeks and months on end. Teams started to lose emotional connection, and group meetings sometimes became cantankerous and dysfunctional because of it. Zoom fatigue became a real thing. Some people were having less fun.
Many people began to long for a return to the office, believing it would eliminate these new stresses. You may be one of these people. 
While you, or any of your team members, may long to get back to the office, an all-in-person structure is likely no longer a viable option for you— many of your team members like being remote and want to stay that way. If you want to keep them, you'll have to accommodate this desire. If you don't, they will leave for a remote company. And if you allow for both remote and office, then you'll have a hybrid structure. 
And this is where the danger begins. Here is why hybrid doesn't work. Sid and Matt believe that there will be a trough of sorrow that companies will go through when they try to implement hybrid remote. Here is why:
Twitter, Square, Facebook, and Shopify allow employees to work remotely, but that doesn't mean that those companies are closing their HQ or offices. 
""Many companies are learning that their workers are just as, or even more productive, working from home,"" all-remote is more effective even though it is happening suddenly, without proper organization, and during a pandemic that itself is stressful and lowering productivity, especially for people that have children that can't go to school.""
Somehow the lesson that companies deduce from this isn't that they should go all remote, but that they should go hybrid, combining remote and co-located work. I think that hybrid is much more challenging and less likely to be successful. This thread will include examples of why it is hard.
These companies are going hybrid for the wrong reasons. According to Mark Zuckerberg, ""Social bond building, culture, creativity, white-boarding, and brainstorming"" needs to happen at the office.


Communication and Connection. When remote, it is vital to be intentional about informal communication (see the link). But that doesn't mean that having part of the people in the office will help make the remote people feel included; instead, it will make it harder to include them. 
Tactics for creating and maintaining human connection remotely 
Speedy meetings of 25 minutes instead of 30 give you time to recover between calls and allow people to join before meetings start for some banter.
Lead with empathy: each work-related call should begin with an earnest, genuine ""How are you?"" or a similar and appropriate introduction. It's important to remember that everyone is facing a battle that you know nothing about, and in a remote setting, you should actively listen.
Welcome interruptions in calls: when pets, children, or partners interrupt a call, this is an opportunity to bond. Take a few minutes to talk to the person if they are open to it or ask the team member about their pet.
Using emojis to convey emotion: The results show that proper use of emoticons, emoji, and stickers, especially positive emotions, is conducive to relationship formation and cognitive understanding. They help participants express emotions and manage interrelations.
Talent shows: they are relatively easy to organize. Simply add a calendar invite two weeks in advance, affix a Google Doc agenda to the invite for team members to sign up to showcase a talent, arrange a panel of 3-5 judges, and have a list of prizes ready to go.
Coffee chats: have a name for 25-minute calls between two people without an agenda. This time empowers people to have these important conversations. There is no agenda, and you can talk about work or not. Make doing them part of onboarding and use@donut to have them happen regularly.
Mixer calls aim to help team members meet more folks from other groups or functions they might not otherwise get to spend a lot of time working or interacting with. Two team members set up a single Zoom line, and each of those team members invites someone else to join.
Juice Box Chats are a chance for GitLab team members and their children, grandchildren, or other members of their family to get to know one another as well. These chats can be informal or focus on a specific topic; Legos, SuperHeroes, camping, and video games are all great.
Team Social Calls are informal social calls regularly scheduled to build camaraderie. The data team has them every Tuesday. Team members and managers are encouraged to create these calls as a medium for informal, agenda-free interaction between team members.
AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions serve as an opportunity to ask funny and far-fetched questions that enable a more personal connection. It's particularly important to consider ongoing AMAs with executives. AMAs humanize leaders and remind teams that we are all more alike than unlike.
Celebrations are essential—for example, the kickoff of a new (fiscal) year or a significant revenue milestone. We've had calls with over 400 team members. Get a great MC to pump up the enthusiasm as@emilieschario does for us.
Holiday parties will be virtual during the pandemic. Think about ways to dress up for the occasion—for example, an ugly sweater competition.
Global pizza parties are where teams arrange shared meals around the world. Global pizza parties, for example, are possible to document and enjoy in a shared setting (Zoom or Slack), though one may wish to consider a breakfast pizza depending on the time zone.
Coworking calls are scheduled working sessions on Zoom where team members can work through challenging tasks with a coworker or simply hang out while each person works on their tasks. Want to try advanced mode? Screen share as you work together.
Collaboration. And stop saying that all creative thinking needs a whiteboard. There are two advantages to a whiteboard (you can draw arrows and circles) but linked are 17 reasons why a shared Google Doc is better, including that everyone can write on it simultaneously.
Who is allowed to be remote? 
At Facebook, employees will have to be at a certain seniority level to work remotely. In our experience, junior people tend to have more experience working digitally, not less.
The same experience in a meeting? Or…Horrible Hybrid Calls! 
With hybrid, it is hard to give everyone the same work experience. Shopify did a great job thinking through this and will require everyone in a meeting to be physically separate and have their camera and audio setup.
If you don't require this, you get hybrid calls, which are horrible (see link). The only thing worse isn't getting invited to the meeting in the first place because the co-located people had an impromptu chat and even forgot to tell you the outcome.
I think that whenever there is a headquarter, there will always be two ways of communicating. To get everyone on the same level, you need the leadership to leave the shared office so that the only headquarter is the one online.
Remote does not have to mean Work From Home. 
During COVID, we tend to equate working remotely with Working From Home (WFH). At GitLab, we'll pay for office space if you want it. WFH will never be the best for everyone. We see some people who prefer an office in the beginning transition to WFH during their first months.
Productive remote people will leave Hybrid for All Remote. 
My prediction is that the leadership will keep working from the headquarters at most hybrid companies, and the default way of working will degrade from 'remote first' to 'remote allowed' (remote employees a second class citizens).
Employees will discover that the company didn't shift from rewarding attendance to rewarding output and that remote workers are not getting promoted at an equal rate because they are less visible. 
The productive remote employees will leave for 'all remote' companies that invested in getting everyone a manager who understands what they do by having only one function reporting to a manager, not a multifunctional team of which the manager doesn't understand most disciplines.
After their most productive remote people leave, the hybrid companies will blame the lack of productivity on remote instead of the actual cause of hybrid being very hard. You'll see the Yahoo/IBM-like moves to force everyone to come to the office again.
Andreas Klinger, who is head of remote at AngelList, summarized this as: ""Returns optionally"" -> leadership goes back -> trips from remote-first to poorly run hybrid -> stop outside of special areas.
Some will go all remote. 
Some companies will go all remote, part of them are already canceling their leases during the pandemic, and another part will do so after finding out that hybrid is complex. Most of these will be successful, which is terrific for the world.
There is so much talent outside of the major metro areas, and all of these people can suddenly compete for the high-paying and rewarding jobs at the world's leading companies. 
Compensation 
Companies will pay market rates based on your location (see link). Rates outside of major metro areas will increase. 
Reporting. No matrix. 
At GitLab, much of the work is multi-disciplinary, but we don't have the different disciplines report to the same manager. Instead, we have stable counterparts, and we require each hire to be a 'manager of one' who can self-organize without a project manager. Here is how we do it.
Whether you believe this or not, you are remote right now and will be for several more months, if not years. You might as well try to get good at it. We challenge you to become an expert at it. If you do, and you conclude that all remote is better, you can declare that you are all remote forever. And if you do that, you instantly get the prizes of all remote. What are they?
You get to start recruiting for open positions from anywhere in the world. It is hard to describe just how beneficial this is until you experience it. On May 20, 2020, Brian Armstrong declared that Coinbase would be remote-first post-COVID. This move instantly allowed the company to start recruiting from anywhere in the world. And within 30 days, Brian declared to me (Matt) that they resolved all of Coinbase's recruiting challenges. Going remote was the single answer!
But let's get back to the problems of remote. If you can solve these, then you get to receive the All Remote prizes.
The primary problems seem to be:
Social bonding
Mental Health
Collaboration
Social bonding
If my team members trust and like each other, then when issues and friction arise, each person's first assumption is that the other is well-meaning, ""we are on the same team,"" and we can find a mutually beneficial solution. We all know that trust and like amongst team members creates a more functional work environment. If, by contrast, trust and like do not exist, then minor friction quickly escalates into anger and dysfunction. 
In the in-person world, we foster trust and like through social bonding. We say hello and goodbye, have occasional informal conversations to connect as human beings. We talk about interests outside of work (in the hallway, over drinks or food, or at an offsite event) and generally see each other doing work (and feel the comfort that work was getting done).
But in a remote world, we don't say hello and goodbye to each other each day, informal communications don't occur unless we intentionally create them, and we don't see each other doing work. 
What is the solution?
In a remote world, we must intentionally create the interactions that naturally happen in an in-person world. And if we do so, we can make them more effective than the organic ones that naturally arose before. 
Here are the things that Gitlab does to formalize informal communications. 
Taking a step back from the tactics, let's ask, ""What creates human connection?""
Matt believes that it's when ...
You know what is important to me. 
You take the time to get to know me as a human. 
At first superficially: My name and some of the important things to me outside of work (my spouse, kids, pets, hobbies, where I grew up, went to school, etc.)
And then more deeply: A dream that I have, a trauma that I have experienced, what makes me feel anger or fear, what I feel shame about, etc.
You recognize and call out the emotions or thoughts that I am experiencing. 
If I feel pain, anger, fear, or sadness, you reach out to me to confirm my feelings and thoughts. Once you have confirmed it, you help me clarify my thoughts when communicating with others. 


That you know what is essential to the organization 
You take the time to understand the priorities of the organization. 
You read the Wiki.
You know what the company Vision and quarterly company OKRs are. You can recite them.
You know the Product Roadmap and the Customer Profile/Problem, no matter what part of your organization.


That you intend to take care of issues that are important to our organization and me. 
Now that you know what is essential to the company and me, I believe that you intend to act in service of those things. You show this to me by specifically describing how what you are doing supports mine and the company's priorities. 
I gain further comfort in your intention by seeing you in multiple situations, and your behavior remains consistent. The magic number is usually five. Once I see you in five different settings or physical locations, I usually tell myself that I know your character. The amount of time I see you in these settings or locations almost doesn't matter. Five minutes is nearly as valuable as five hours. 


That you are competent. 
To achieve this care, you understand what the most important thing to do is (insightful), can take the time and space to do it (organized), and you do it well (skilled). 
We have already covered insight above. 
For organization, I either see you getting things done or using a system that I know to be effective (i.e., Getting Things Done by David Allen, Monday.com, Asana, etc.). 
For skill, I simply judge your work. But if you know my interest, show that you addressed it and organized it… that is 90% of the performance I am looking for. 
For most people, it's important to laugh and have fun. If you create this for me, you are taking care of me. But you don't need to be a comedian. If you organize an event where I have fun, I give you as much credit as the comic who made me laugh. 
Most people love to talk about themselves, as well as the people and topics they hold dear. You need not have any prior knowledge of these topics. You need only ask, be willing to listen to the answers, and appear to be interested. 
So, to create a human connection, create moments where people can;
Get to know each other as humans, both the superficial details of their life and the more serious ones.

Drama Triangle (and 100% Responsibility),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0_uQLGnf8gt3bQEOQhGH-bJhY_Zb62eyEl1YdfVS1s/edit ,"Drama Triangle (and 100% Responsibility)

Whenever we see a problem, we often feel some degree of anger and fear. This causes our brain to go into some level of ""fight or flight"" mode, which causes us to be more interested in convincing others that our solution is right, rather than getting curious about what we can learn (from others and the situation). If you believe, as I do, that better solutions come from shifting to a place of curiosity rather than wanting to be correct, the critical question then becomes: ""How do I shift?""
There are many ways to do so. Below is one. 
This method asks each of us to:
First, state in starkest terms our thoughts come from wanting to be right (""below the line""). If we can express them verbally, then we can often let go of our attachment to them. This step is sometimes the only action needed to move to a productive conversation and easeful solution.
Second, rather than look at the problem as externally-created (and therefore only externally-solvable), we state what we did to create the situation (""above the line""). This statement often highlights what we can do to solve it. Again, this second step may be enough to move to an easeful solution.
Third, if we want to understand why we feel Fear or Anger in these situations (and then cut those feelings off at the source), we can think back deeply into our childhood to see when this pattern first appeared, as it likely appeared as a very normal response of a young child to an external stimulus. If we can see that, then we can see how that ""persona"" was helpful to us as a child but is no longer beneficial to us as adults now.
Fourth, if we have shifted to a place of curiosity, we then state if we are willing to discover a resolution quickly. If the answer is yes, then we proceed.
Fifth, discuss amongst the group, discover a solution and make agreements.
Identify issue:
Below the Line:
Steps:
""I blame (a person's name) for (an action)."" Villain
""This negatively affects me in the following way …."" Victim
""I temporarily solve this situation by …."" Hero
Once you complete one round, go back to Step 1 and pick a different person. If Steps 2 and 3 are identical, there is no need to repeat them.
Continue going through the Steps until there is no one else to blame. Remember, you can always blame yourself.

Above the Line:
I created this situation by…
Questions to answer to help you take 100% responsibility:
What do you have to be right about?
What do you withhold, and from whom?
What do you not face?
What feelings do you repress/conceal?
What do you have to believe about yourself, others, and the world?
How do you numb yourself from the discomfort?
What ""shoulds"" do you have to believe?
What behaviors do you do or not do to keep the issue in place?
To what do you feel entitled?
What are you trying to control that is NOT in your control?
What do you believe you do not have enough of?
What either/or story do you have to hold about this issue?
Who do you have to be better/less than?
What agreements do you have to make and/or break with yourself or others?
What do you have to be afraid of?
The long-standing pattern this reminds me of is…
Am I willing to now easefully and playfully discover a solution?

DRIs:  Directly-Responsible Individuals (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit ,"DRIs:  Directly-Responsible Individuals (3 min)

""We have many projects and metrics that no one is directly responsible for … and therefore, we get neither reporting nor action on them.""
If you run your company with actions, projects, goals (OKRs), and decisions, you also need DRI - Directly-Responsible Individuals.
You likely already know this for actions. It's pretty clear that if something needs to get done, someone needs to do it. Stating: ""One of you, please get this done.""… will result in no one doing the task. There clearly needs to be one named person, a due date, and a way to later check if that person actually completed the task, i.e., through an Agreement-Tracker: why you need one (3 min).
So, a DRI is needed for an action to get done and reported on.
In the same way, you need a DRI for every:
Metric
Goal
Project
Meeting
Decision
This DRI is responsible for reporting status as well as pushing toward the goal line.
Every metric, OKR, and project in the company should be listed, along with the DRI and a reporting cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly). All reporting should be written and attached to this tracking document. Those reports can also be given verbally at Meetings: Reviews (Pipeline, Project/Business Unit, Cross-Departments). But even if you present verbally, these reports should still be written and maintained in a public place for all to refer to at any time. 
The pushback that I regularly hear:
""Yes, but who should the DRI be? If we make it someone junior, they don't have the authority to compel people to action. And the senior people are all already overloaded."" 


My answer:
 
Someone as DRI is better than no one, even if that person doesn't have full authority to influence. If they cannot influence, they can Clean Escalate to the Apex Manager, who has full authority (i.e., they can fire/hire).


""DRIs will be laser-focused on gathering resources for their project, metric, goal, etc. They will over-optimize for their particular responsibility, and not think about what's best overall for the company, leading to a suboptimal result."" 


My answer: 


This is indeed a problem. But the much bigger problem is the apathy that comes along without DRIs. 


And you can address this problem through Clean Escalations from those who get needed resources pulled away. 


""If we make a junior person the DRI, they will make decisions without enough context, and those decisions won't be good ones."" 


My answer:


The DRI needs to report regularly in a review: 


What they did


The current status


What they plan to do


Their Manager is, therefore, the Decision-Maker on overall direction. 


This is akin to a Recruiter that you hire. 


The Recruiter is the DRI responsible for finding great candidates and helping to close the one you like. 


But you, as Hiring Manager, are the decision-maker who decides which candidate to make an offer to.
When it comes to Projects, please consider the following:
Do not allocate resources until the project's intended impact is defined and a DRI assigned. This action will cause short-term pain (projects taking a few days longer to get started) but long-term joy (no orphans).
Beware of a proliferation of projects that continue to live even when they should die. You will need to look at, and be ruthless about, projects regularly. Kill all the ones that no longer are high priority or are not succeeding. 
Pick a cadence for project reporting (likely monthly), as well as a cadence for the live/die decision (likely quarterly).","Assign Directly-Responsible Individuals (DRIs) for actions, metrics, goals, projects, meetings, decisions to ensure accountability, progress, and reporting."

### Part 1: Meetings are expensive

Many companies rely primarily on face-to-face meetings to make decisions.

**However, this is costly to the company in a few ways:**

1. When each member has to take out time in their day to give attention to the issue at the same time, it’s costly. 
2. Discussions can be delayed because meetings are scheduled around each individual’s availability. Especially if your team is remote and globally distributed. Multiple timezones overlap making meetings more expensive and difficult to schedule.
3. Team members experience Zoom or meeting fatigue. This causes the team’s productivity to decrease over time.

Some CEOs I coach use Google docs and Slack for async discussions. They empower their executive team to move away from solely relying on meetings. The results are below:

- **Faster decision-making**
    
    When we don’t need to coordinate meetings, decisions can be made as soon as teammates read and comment, thus shortening the decision timeline.
    
- **Decreased the number of meetings**
    
    Meetings can be either shortened or eliminated. This preserves each teammate’s calendar, leaving ample time for deep work or focus time.
    
- **Live meetings are more efficient**
    
    The meetings you end up holding become more efficient because there are fewer decisions that are made during live syncs. Therefore, meetings become more focused and efficient.
    

### Part 2a: What are the use cases of async discussions?

Here are the criteria for a great async discussion:

- **It’s a Type 2 decision**
    
    A Type 2 decision is easily reversible. You can read [Decision-Making](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPdWQjYfdK0SB2i3ViZ9XsMPjTYEi7Do1WI22ofmEdo/edit#) for a more detailed definition of Type 1 and Type 2 decisions.
    
- **It requires multiple people to provide their input**
    
    The more people involved, the more pre-read and pre-write can help. And if you have more than six people who are providing input, you probably have a terribly inefficient live discussion, which means async writing is even more important. 
    

### Part 2b: What are NOT great use cases of async discussions?

These characteristics make a discussion not great for async:

- **It’s a Type 1 decision**
    
    Type 1 decisions are not reversible. They are “one-way doors”. You can read [Decision-Making](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPdWQjYfdK0SB2i3ViZ9XsMPjTYEi7Do1WI22ofmEdo/edit#) for a more detailed definition of Type 1 and Type 2 decisions.
    
- **Constructive feedback to an individual or a team**
    
    Unless the feedback is 100% positive, it shouldn’t be given in an asynchronous format. Read more about our philosophy on [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit).
    
- **It may elicit emotional responses**
    
    Any topic that’s highly triggering or emotional is best done live in a meeting. Asynchronous communication doesn’t help you observe others’ immediate reactions and [make them feel heard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit).
    

### Part 3: How to set up a system of async discussions

<aside>
💡 We recommend two systems using [Threads](https://threads.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/).  Untoggle below to read more.

</aside>

- **Using Threads Asynchronously for Decisions**
    
    *🔑* We use Threads alongside our [Issue / Proposed Solution template (group)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jOoTu44L22LG-_DfnTNdscBg2EJ_dSZgTujc5utK4yc/edit#heading=h.b81xwnfqvmsc). Here’s an example.
    
    1. **Create a discussion**
        
        I am the proposer and the decision-maker of an issue. I don’t want to wait until our next Coaching team sync to bring it up. I also don’t think it’s necessary to take up live time to discuss this issue. I am writing about an issue in the IPS format.
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-06-17 at 2.33.19 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e36370fe-9f89-47ee-acdf-97a6b961997a/Screen_Shot_2022-06-17_at_2.33.19_PM.png)
        
    2. **Decide on a due date**
        
        On Threads, I pick a time and date I’d like my colleagues to respond by using Thread’s natively built function.
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-06-17 at 2.36.04 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d51ad677-3a5d-4b8b-bd56-0311183f2ef7/Screen_Shot_2022-06-17_at_2.36.04_PM.png)
        
    3. **Colleagues comment**
        
        I wait for my colleagues to comment and converse with them back and forth if needed. I’ll answer their questions, or ask them clarifying questions
        
    4. **Make a decision**
        
        On the due date, I’ll evaluate if I have enough information to make a decision. If yes, I’ll mark a comment as a decision. 
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-06-17 at 2.36.37 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/15a7fe29-40d1-4e9c-9707-03545d9f9932/Screen_Shot_2022-06-17_at_2.36.37_PM.png)
        
        If I haven’t reached a decision, I will consider how to continue the discussion. It may useful to bring up the issue in a live meeting. If I bring it to the live meeting, it’ll take less time to reach a conclusion because the team already has context. Or, I can extend the deadline and continue in the comment section. 
        
    
    *🔑 What I love about Threads is that it tracks all your decisions in a tab. So you don’t have to worry about losing the history and context of decisions.* 
    
- **Use Slack Asynchronously for Communication**
    
    A great use case for Slack is to create async channels with your direct report. This will help you triage your Slack messages to better manage your time. 
    
    1. **Create a private channel between you and each of your direct reports.**
        
        This is an example of my channel with my manager, Regina Gerbeaux.
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-06-17 at 2.40.26 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/004eb3e9-2d91-4885-a7df-cd10d821f1ca/Screen_Shot_2022-06-17_at_2.40.26_PM.png)
        
    2. **Give your direct report verbal and/or written context.** 
        
        Here is a great example of how to set it up in Slack. Regina’s written context was so clear that she didn’t need to provide additional verbal context to me.
        
        💡Bonus tip that I learned from Regina is to organize this channel in thread and comment format. It keeps the conversation clean and easy to flip up or down.
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-06-17 at 2.41.38 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/24fdc11c-2030-4633-b93f-f64ce0180b98/Screen_Shot_2022-06-17_at_2.41.38_PM.png)
        
    3. **Test it with new discussion topics**
        
        I recommend that you be the first active user of the system. Start to seed this channel with topics and tag your direct report to get adoption. 
        
    4. **Ask your direct report to try it with one other person**
        
        The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. Once your direct report starts to post discussions to your async channel, they are ready to share it. Ask the to set up a new channel with one of their direct reports.
        

### **Part 4: How do I teach my team this method?**

It’s normal for you or your team to feel resistance to a new method. 

We have a detailed write-up on how you can make the transition easier. Please read [Transition:  How to successfully transition a group to a new method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlgcnKgY5AIl9IcWZJaywXHU6bg9Y8nOb-aqNNxbics/edit).","Face-to-face meetings can be costly and lead to delays and fatigue.

Emotions - name them (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qViPEjTQ7XlkvZAqU1YZQYJtpPqgjvyxPaKXpwbb_L4/edit ,"Emotions - name them (1 min)

We all experience emotions. There is nothing wrong with them. In fact, they are healthy and contain their intelligence. 
I posit that there are five basic emotions -- excitement, joy, fear, anger, and sadness -- and that all other emotions are simply a shade of these basic ones, just as all colors are some combination of red, yellow, and blue.
Excitement is future-looking. We don't know what will occur, but we predict that it will be good.
Fear is future-looking. We don't know what will happen, and we predict that it will not be good.
Joy is present. What is happening right now is good.
Anger is present. What is happening right now is not good.
Sadness is the past. What has already happened in the past is not good and is likely unrecoverable. This emotion can be a death of a person or a vision of what could have been. 
So, emotions are an alert for us to notice. That is healthy. But when we experience fear or anger, our brain function moves from our pre-frontal cortex (creative thought) to our amygdala (fight or flight response), which is only capable of minimal thought. 
","Emotions are healthy and intelligent. Five basic emotions are excitement, joy, fear, anger, and sadness. They serve as alerts for us to notice."
Energy Audit (4 min to read; 45 min to do),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Energy Audit (3 min)
(I learned this exercise from Diana Chapman of the Conscious Leadership Group.)
It is essential to maximize your energy. You perform best when you are doing things that energize you. There is excellent brain science around this from Robert Sapolsky of Stanford. His work is so good that I recommend you access it directly by reading Behave or listening to his explanation in this video (1h13m).
Your goal should be to spend most of your time (75-80%) doing things that energize you. If you do, magic will occur.
Get two highlighters, pens, or pencils of different colors (red and green are ideal, but any will do). Print out the last two weeks of your calendar (from the past, not the future) when you were working, and that is representative of your everyday experience (i.e., if you did something unusual in the last two weeks like go on a big trip, then pick the two weeks prior). Add in activities you did in between meetings, before work, and after work. If you don't have a printer, do this.
Go through each workday hour-by-hour and ask yourself, ""Did that activity give me energy or drain my energy?"" Highlight those that gave you energy in green and red those that did not provide you with energy. There are no neutrals; every hour must be marked one color or the other. If an hour does not give you energy, it is red. (If you want to take a shortcut, you can just mark the reds.)
When finished, write out a list of each of the reds. 
Then group those activities into similar buckets. (i.e., 1-1 meetings, recruiting meetings, etc.)
For each type of activity that does not raise your energy, write down ways to:
Outsource it,
Eliminate it, or
Make it exquisite (i.e., meetings that you believe you must attend).
Turn each of these into actions with due dates and put them in your Task Manager.
Keep doing this Energy Audit each month until you're spending 75% or more doing things that give you energy. If you do, you will achieve far more in less time because you will perform far better. You will be in your Zone of Genius.
There are some common actions that don't give people energy. To these, you need to say ""no!"" Here are some ways to do that: No - how to say it


Zone of Genius
What is the Zone of Genius? Well, there are four zones.
Zone of Incompetence.
Zone of Competence.
Zone of Excellence.
Zone of Genius.
Zone of Incompetence is what other people probably do better than you (i.e., fix your car), and therefore you should outsource if they don't give you joy.
Zone of Competence is what you do just fine, but others are as good as you (i.e., clean your bathroom), and therefore you should outsource if they don't give you joy.
Zone of Excellence is what you are excellent at (i.e., better than others) but don't love doing. This area is the danger zone. Many people will want you to keep doing these things (as they gain significant value from you doing them), but this is the area that you should also look to move away from. This is the hard one!
Zone of Genius is the things you are uniquely good at in the world and that you love to do (so much that time and space likely disappear when you do them). This zone is where you can add the most value to the world and yourself. This area is where you should be driving toward spending most, if not all, of your time.
Some people worry that if each of us operates solely in our Zone of Genius, no one will be available to do the un-fun stuff. This is a false fear. There are many personality types. For every activity that feels un-fun to you, there is someone out there who not only excels at it but loves it. (Yes, even the ""horrible"" tasks, like firing people.) The key in any organization is for people to be transparent about what their Zone of Genius is and then map all activities to the right people (through an AORs list).

Many of the CEOs that I coach have become big fans of this Energy Audit. Mathilde Collin of Front is such a fan that she wrote up her own post about it. You will notice very similar content. The difference is her personal examples.",Maximize energy by identifying activities that energize you. Use an energy audit to allocate time wisely for optimal performance.
Engineering excellence:  Rubber Duck channels (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ru-vWXperFNPZDqjzAmLH242HMrPbjyDrSBDrhVzaOk/edit ,"Engineering excellence:  Rubber Duck channels (2 min)

Video of Matt interviewing Aaron White, CEO of Blissfully (about 1 hour):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RkL24RcDJisG9ydL1-rfanw3UR3zgjcI/view

(These ideas came from Matt Mochary interviewing Aaron White.  Aaron is the founder and CEO of Blissfully, which was purchased by Vendr, because Ryan Neu (CEO of Vendr) deemed Blissfully to be the one of the most, if not the most, productive engineering orgs Ryan had ever seen.)

One of the primary tenets of creating excellence in an engineering org is speed.  Speed from idea to prototype.  Speed from getting stuck on a problem to getting help.  Speed from having feedback to give to actually giving that feedback.  Speed from realizing that someone doesn’t meet the talent bar to letting them go (with kindness).

By this point, it is a well-accepted tenet that an engineering organization that has true talent density (see No Rules Rules) is far more effective than one that doesn’t have it.  But how to get there?

One of Aaron’s key tools is the Rubber Duck channel.

Rubber Ducking is a familiar concept to most engineers.  If you are struggling to solve a problem, it often helps to say it out loud to someone else.  By explaining it, the answer often appears.  So much so that you don’t even need to explain it to another person.  You can simply put a Rubber Duck on your desk and explain the problem to the duck.  

Aaron takes this familiar concept and puts in online … actually on Slack.  Each person in the engineering org gets their own “Rubber Duck channel” in Slack.  There, they can write out the engineering problems that they face.  This often leads to the solution.  But if it doesn’t, it also allows the more senior engineers to quickly see when another engineer is stuck and offer helpful suggestions.  These channels also allow the whole team to learn from the most senior engineers, to see how they solve problems.  

Those who don’t use the channels don’t get immediate help, and therefore often struggle to keep up.  Anyone who struggles to keep up receives feedback quickly.  

As soon as Aaron has the thought “Hmmm, that person isn’t doing what I would hope they would do.”, Aaron does not wait more than 24 hours before letting the person know, as well as what exactly he hopes they would do (ie- speed to feedback).

Once Aaron gives someone direct feedback, if they don’t fully repair within 2 weeks, Aaron fires them well. 

The channels are so effective that Aaron now tests an engineer’s ability to use the channel during the interview process.  Aaron gives the engineer a problem to solve on the spot that he knows the engineer will not have time to solve.  Aaron tells them that, and simply asks them to share their thinking out loud as they tussle with the problem.  Aaron is not looking for a solution, he is simply looking for their willingness to let their struggling thoughts be known by others.

Once they join the company, he encourages them to start using their Rubber Duck channel instantly, even as they are onboarding.  This also gives Aaron valuable feedback on the onboarding process itself so that he can improve it quickly.

If a new engineer does not use the Rubber Duck channel, Aaron gives them feedback within 24 hours that they need to.  If they continue to not use the channel, or they continue to struggle in the same way even after getting help, Aaron lets them go quickly.  Aaron feels that he knows within 2 weeks whether someone will be a great addition to the team.  All that are not, he lets go within days.  

This is a radical approach.  And it works.  ","Aaron White, CEO of Blissfully, uses Rubber Duck channels on Slack for engineering problem-solving, feedback, and quick decisions on team members."
Engineering:  How to increase speed and quality (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yL_m10CT6bIVsvSfjsCcm_Q4phMP63DDmItepDONQg0/edit ,"Engineering:  How to increase speed and quality (2 min)

Your engineering team is not producing fast enough. And what they are producing is laden with bugs that need to be fixed. 
How to correct this? The answer seems obvious: hire more engineers and get a VP of Engineering that knows how to actually manage them. Right?!
Oftentimes … wrong!
Building an application is in many ways like building a house. If a master builder assembles the foundation, floors, walls, roof, electrical, and plumbing … she will know how everything interconnects and builds things that work well together. 
However, if a junior builder gets added to the team, he will be given a task (like building a wall) that needs to be reviewed, which takes the master builder's time. That review might reveal something wrong that needs to be fixed, which takes more of the master builder's time (imagine having to pull out nails and then redo the wall). This time to fix is often more than when it would have taken the master builder to build the wall itself. But, much more insidiously, the master-builder may well find the process of reviewing and fixing other people's work draining, leaving her with far less energy to create herself, and in the end, having junior team members may be net negative to overall productivity. 
So, before you hire more people and add even more burden of reviewing and fixing (and now coordinating with a large team) to your master builder, talk to your master builder first. Consider the possibility that she is more effective if she doesn't have to mentor and review. 
At some point, of course, you will need more than one builder. Consider, however, that senior developers whose code is clean and requires little review (and rarely any fixing) are the only ones who are net positive. While they cost 3x, they actually produce the proverbial 10x … mainly because the junior engineers produce close to net zero.
You are now likely thinking: ""Matt, there just aren't enough senior engineers in the world. We'd love to hire only senior folks, but we can't find them. We need to bring on junior engineers so that we can eventually train them to be senior.""
That is absolutely true. But then recognize that you are training. Create an actual training program. Do not sap the energy and time of your senior developers with this process. Have it happen off to the side, where the teachers are only those who actually derive energy from the process of teaching and mentoring.
Major League Baseball has the same issue. For that reason, they have farm teams. But you don't see the star major league player being required to mentor the minor league players. Don't ask yours to, either.",Hiring more engineers isn't always the answer. Focus on quality over quantity. Train juniors separately to avoid draining seniors.
Events in the world: how to address them?,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyB9a9CQJ76eBPu1VeZZzR3vmLbTzwbra8wvb1-8LzE/edit ,"Events in the world: how to address them?

A mass shooting where children are killed.
A Supreme Court decision that curtails the rights of individuals, or restricts the ability of states to limit deadly weapons.
A militia commits genocide.

Events like these occur in the world on a regular basis.  For many they are tragic and cause or augment a feeling of distress and despair.  

When a person feels sadness, the healthiest thing for them to do is to release the emotion by feeling it all the way through. Sadness: how to process it.

This process is often aided by someone being willing to listen and making the person feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).

As a company, I recommend that you adopt a policy of helping people process their sadness, anger or fear when they feel it.  But many managers will not get energy from doing it, nor do they feel that they have the time.  No problem.  

You can offer access to a therapist who will.  There are now excellent and reasonably-priced therapy apps available.  Let people know about them.  You can even offer to cover them as part of your health benefits.

When an external event occurs that feels big, you can take it as a moment to remind your team that you encourage them to process their feelings, and remind of the resources available for them to do so.

But in your message to the team, please do not fall into the trap of raging at the world yourself or taking a political stance.  





There is a deeper reality that is not worth sharing with anyone until they are ready to hear it …

The world simply exists.  It does not cause us to be sad, fearful or angry.  Instead we cause ourselves to feel this way.  Releasing those emotions will get us back to joy and excitement.  Recognizing that the world simply is will help us not make ourselves feel sadness, fear or anger in the first place.

Video (older) of Matt describing the Exec Ops role (5 min) 
If you find that you are simply not completing the goals you set for yourself each week, or you do so, but some or many of the tasks are energy-draining, then it is time to hire an Exec Ops (formerly called Chief of Staff). 
An Exec Ops has become such an effective hire for the CEOs that I coach that I now require it before coaching someone. I think it's the very first hire that you should make, whether I'm coaching you or not.
Not only does the Exec Ops ensure that your actions get done, but they are also process-oriented and can run the repetitive steps required in a sound management system. They can literally run your company for you. 
Mark Organ, CEO of Influitive, gives a thorough description of CoS best practices in his First Round blog post. To me, the two priorities in creating a great Exec Ops are:
Their background


How you train them
There are several types of Exec Ops.   
A more junior version who does not have ambition to run a department, who only wants to support you.  This person will be your super-charged personal and executive assistant.
A more senior version who does have ambition to run a department, whether a fleshed out Exec Ops with more team members, or to move to running one of the departments in the company.
A very senior version who has enough years of experience that other exec team members will eventually accept reporting to this person.  This version will become your strategic thought-partner and help craft the future vision of the company and the product.  This version can, and will want to, eventually become your COO.
Whatever type you hire first, I think that eventually you will want both a senior version (who can run a department for you) and a junior version who will remain in the Exec Ops for the long-term.
Background. 
The best Exec Ops' are highly organized, excellent communicators (both written and oral), and you simply like spending time with them (because you will be spending a lot of time with them!).
For the more junior version, I recommend someone who is and wants to be a personal and executive assistant.  It is important that they do NOT have an ambition to run their own department or company, as you want this person to stay in this support role for many years.


For the more senior version, you also want them to have broad strategic business knowledge. An environment that almost always ensures these skills is several years at a top management consulting firm (Bain, BCG, and McKinsey). I am partial to Bain, as I find x-Bain consultants also have excellent financial modeling skills (akin to those that they would have learned had they worked as an associate at an investment bank). In addition, it is nice if they have 1-2 years of experience in the tech world to be familiar with current productivity tools. But this is, IMHO, a nice-to-have, not a requirement.  


For the very senior version, you want them to have more years in a consulting firm, or years managing a team (doesn’t need to be a big one) in a tech company. (i.e., 10-15 years of work experience).


The years of work experience don’t confer any real benefit, other than the fact that psychologically it is easier for execs (who are usually in their 30s and 40s) to report to someone who is at least in their 30s. 
Training. 
The key is to give your Exec Ops unfettered access to all the information that you receive. It would be best to have the Exec Ops sit beside you from morning till night, with full access to your emails, calls, meetings, etc. By seeing what decisions you make, based on what information you receive, she will soon be able to think like you, and then she can truly be an extension of you (and magic will happen).


If you are a remote company, it is still important for your Exec Ops to sit with you in person during their training period (the first 3-6 months).  
After that, they can shadow you remotely via a Zoom link that you leave open with screen share on while you are working on solo tasks.
After several weeks of observing, your Exec Ops can start to take tasks off of your plate. Within several months, she will be able to do all the functions that don't give you energy or that you don't have the capacity to do. 
Phil Levine at Golden Gate Recruits is an excellent recruiter for this position, as he is x-Bain and has many contacts in that world.
Another effective recruiting tool is your social media presence. This role is essentially about enthusiasm rather than specific skills. The person is making the trade of being willing to ""do your laundry"" in exchange for getting to watch your life. For that, they need to be a big fan of your life. And if they are, then they most likely already follow you on social media. 
Most senior candidates are not attracted to the Exec Ops role because they view it as an ""assistant"" role. And in many companies, it is. So, when recruiting, dispel this concern by showing the candidate that they will have full access to all the information that you do. And that is the single best training to become a CEO (or head of any department) that exists.
The pushback that I get on this role from CEOs is: 
""Won't I be perceived as an asshole that thinks she's too important to talk to people directly?""
Yes. If you force people to talk to your Exec Ops before they can talk to you. Don't ever do that. Your Exec Ops can draft emails on your behalf. But don't ever allow them to be your gatekeeper (i.e., intercept emails and respond themselves). Communicate with people directly, especially when you need to say ""no"" or make a request.


""I am looking for the perfect person and can't find them.""
Don't wait for perfection here. Pick someone good, and have the Exec Ops start shadowing you. It's the shadowing that is most important as no one will perform on Day 1. They need to shadow you for 30 days before they have enough context to do anything. I therefore encourage you to start that 30-day clock as soon as possible.
At first, the Exec Ops role may seem unattractive to many good candidates. That is because there are two types of Exec Ops. 
One Exec Ops is a glorified gopher. This person does not have access to the CEO's email and does not shadow her in all meetings. Instead, from Day 1, this Exec Ops does the projects that don't fall neatly into any department. While these projects are critical to the company's success, this Exec Ops role has no career plan. There is no clear transition to managing a team or a department, so this role turns off strong candidates. They perceive it as a dead-end.
The other Exec Ops has full access. They see the CEO's email, and, in the beginning, they shadow her in all meetings. In this position, the Exec Ops sees all of the CEO's information and then quickly understands every role and function in the company. For the person in the Exec Ops role, it is the most intense CEO training that exists. Yes, the CEO will ask their Exec Ops to take as much off their plate as possible. At first, this will include simple admin tasks. But there are not very many of those. And this Exec Ops will be authorized to hire whatever support staff they need (their own EA) to complete all of these tasks. That then leaves the Exec Ops to do more significant functions over time. Many Exec Ops in this role eventually either take over the running of a department, or even the people management of the Exec Team (i.e., running the 1-1s and team meetings), making them de facto COO.
If you make it clear that you are offering the latter role, candidates will be far more interested.  
Here is a good perspective of the Chief of Staff role (what I am now calling Exec Ops from a former CoS. 
Titles.
The more junior and middle versions of this role are likely:
Exec Ops (or CEO Ops)


The very senior version of this role is likely:
Chief of Staff

I finally received the first negative feedback on an Exec Ops hire. The Exec Ops had started doing 1-1s with all executive team members, who had shared their frustrations about the founder. The Exec Ops, however, was conflict-avoidant and neither relayed the feedback to the founder nor caused the execs to give the feedback directly. The execs thought that their feedback was being delivered and became even more frustrated when they saw no action or response from the founder.
When I heard this story, I said to the founder: ""That sounds terrible. So, this Exec Ops role has been a bust for you?"" The founder responded: ""Not at all. They have done a great job of helping me run meetings, making sure that everyone is prepared, and following up afterward. Totally worth it.""

When you hire an Exec Ops for the first time, you will likely experience lots of relief once that person begins to take tasks off of your plate (usually within the first 60 days).  This relief will only grow as they fully onboard (3-6 months) and start to jump on bigger and bigger tasks.  At this point, they often take over the management of an ailing department (or two).  They will likely do a great job in this role, but suddenly a new (and very big) problem will arise … they are no longer shadowing you and taking as many minor (but burdensome) tasks off of your plate.  And suddenly your life will get worse.
There is a very easy solution here.  Once you realize that the Exec Ops position is a valuable one (most CEOs realize this at the 2-3 month mark), immediately ask your Exec Ops to hire 1-2 more CoS types.  These new folks will become “Members of the Office of the CEO”.  They will shadow you in the same way that your first Exec Ops does, and they too will be onboarded within 2-3 months.   Now, each team member will be qualified to:
Shadow you consistently and take administrative tasks off of your plate, or
Investigate and solve cross-department issues, or 
Run an ailing department
They can do one or the other well, but not any two.  If your first Exec Ops wants to go run a department, she can.  But not before there is another “Member of the Office of the CEO” ready to take her place as your Exec Ops.
When this happens, your first Exec Ops will likely experience fear that she will no longer be as connected to you, and the trust will eventually erode.  This is just her fear talking, because once the trust is established, it lasts for a very long time.  
Once you have an Exec Ops, make sure that they are regularly recruiting and onboarding more members (who report to the Exec Ops).  These are your smokejumpers.  Don’t ever be left without 1-2 available to you.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
""I'm a huge fan of the Chief of Staff role. Mine runs all OKRs and roadmap planning, and I ask him to do work I otherwise would do before. The latest example is that we had to collect feedback from 15+ people on a meaty set of issues we had to resolve, so he went and spoke with them and shared his notes along with recommended actions. He improves our management system and rolls out changes across the company - e.g., we want to add a new section to company goal meetings, so he'll work with each company goal owner to make sure they do it right. He has a team of 10 people who we dispatch into departments who struggle with our management system or need temp help. His team project manages high-priority cross-functional initiatives like IPO readiness. He and his team (the CEO's office) ensure that we are a well-run company and that I'm not dependent on making that happen consistently across all departments.
I should also add that he was at the company five years before I made him my chief of staff, and nearly everyone on his team has been at the company for at least two years before being on his team, and all show a huge commitment to the culture and are excellent at execution.""
Chris Mansi, CEO of Viz.ai
""I agree with Matt [about not waiting for the ideal background]. I promoted my EA to CoS. She did not have the typical GSB/HBS/McKinsey background, but we did the 30-day shadowing period, and it's been amazing, both for the company and me. It is important that you trust the person completely as you'll likely have them in every meeting you take, including comp/challenging conversations. I also like the idea of promoting from within the org.""","Exec Ops (formerly Chief of Staff) role described by Matt.

Instructions
In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the CEO and Exec Team and between Exec Team peers. 
As members of the Exec Team, we want to share our experience and observations with the CEO and our peers to help each succeed (and therefore make our collective equity more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass those people (imagine the pain of creating an enemy out of any one of them!), so we rarely give our full critical Feedback, and certainly not in the group setting of an Exec Team meeting.
As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our incredibly knowledgeable Exec Team. But we often forget to ask for this specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.
Both the Executive Team's withholding and not asking for Feedback from the CEO cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.
The exercise:
We schedule 2 hours (actually 1 hour and 50 minutes) together. All Exec Team members, the CEO, and Matt. 
When you schedule the meeting, please email-connect Matt to all the participants to ensure that they do all the pre-work below.


All attendees do this pre-work: 
Read this doc (3 min)
Read Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s (3 min)
Optional.  If you want more detail, you can read Feedback (15 min)
Write down (in a private note that only you have access to so that your writings do not influence others): 
1-5.  
How is the CEO performing 1-5?
3 is “meeting expectations”
5 is “she couldn’t be any better”
1 is “she couldn’t be any worse”
LIKE.  
What actions the CEO has done that you like?  Please …
Give a clear example (ie- “On March 22, you did the following …”
Write only one LIKE.  The CEO just needs to see/hear that you see some value in them.  But anything more than one LIKE is overkill.
WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL.  
What actions the CEO would need to take to get to the next level of performance (1-5).  Please …
Give the rawest WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback that you can think of. The CEO will unpack only the rawest. Yes, it's a competition!
Focus your Feedback on the behaviors of the CEO, not company issues. (Company issues are a different exercise.)
Write specific actions that you want the CEO to do. Please be very specific. 
Good: 
When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now.  I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”
Not good: 
Don’t act in anger.
Write only one set of NEXT LEVEL feedback.  The CEO will not have time to read more than one set from each person.  So please pick the single most important and impactful piece of feedback.  
During our meeting/call 
Brief introduction of the purpose of the meeting. [2 minutes]
Matt creates a shared Doc. All paste their Feedback into that doc. [2 minutes]
Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. [6 minutes] 
The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship. 
All read through all of the WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback. [10 minutes] 
Each person adds in comment +1 to WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback from others that they agree with. 
CEO picks the single juiciest and most popular Feedback, and fully unpacks it. [20 minutes] 
CEO asks the author to state the feedback verbally so that the CEO can fully understand it.  
CEO thanks the author for being willing to share this information. It took bravery. 
CEO summarizes what she thinks she read and asks, ""Is that right?"" 
If the CEO wants to go to the advanced level, she will summarize what the person is really thinking (with swear words!) and feeling, as that is usually much bigger than what they are willing to write/say. Example: 
What was written: 
When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now.  I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”
What is likely in their head: 
Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!
If the author says ""No,"" the author restates, and the CEO tries to summarize again. Repeat until the author says ""Yes.""
Once the author says ""Yes,"" then the CEO asks, ""Is there more?""
Once the author says, ""No, that's it,"" the CEO asks, ""Do you feel heard?""
Once the author says ""Yes,"" then ...
CEO declares whether or not she accepts the Feedback. 
There is no requirement to accept. She only does so if the Feedback resonates with her.
If the CEO accepts the Feedback, all team members do a Brainstorming: written for 3 minutes to list what actions the CEO could take to enact the feedback.  [10 minutes]
The CEO reviews all the actions, and declares which ones she accepts. 
When declaring an action, it is critical to write down: 
What the action is
The date by which it will be done
Who will do it
If the CEO does not accept the Feedback, she shares with the author what is going on in the CEO's world to show why she does not accept the Feedback.  [5 minutes]
""Here is what is going on for me. (Then explain all that is happening.) Given that, how can I accept this Feedback?""
The CEO's description should be so thorough that it becomes clear to the author why the Feedback isn't actionable.
The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL feedback from other authors (ideally unpacking one from each author) until the meeting time is over, or the CEO processes all of the juicy Feedback. [50 minutes]
Wrap up. Appreciate one other person in the group for something they did during the meeting. [5 minutes]
Give written Feedback to Matt about the meeting itself [5 minutes]


""Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt.""
Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full Feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that Feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the Feedback as an attack, not a gift. This reaction rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And that is why Matt is there. 
If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release her anger and see the Feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if Matt is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.
Notes:
I have done this exercise at Plaid, Coinbase, Brex, Sonder, Attentive, etc. Each of those exec teams and CEOs has found it to be worthwhile.
The full version of this exercise takes 110 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50-80 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.
If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then there is a follow-up: 
CEO asks for Feedback in all 1-1s and Team Meetings going forward: 
CEO asks for written Feedback at the end of every Exec Team meeting or 1-1.
CEO treats all Feedback as the gift it is.
After the CEO has read the Feedback (can be after the team meeting), she lets the team know what actions she will take against that Feedback.
At the beginning of the next team meeting, she lets the team know which of these actions he has completed and the results.
Peers give each other Feedback in the Team Meeting. 
After several successful cycles of giving the CEO feedback, ask the Exec Team if they would be open to providing Feedback and receiving Feedback to and from each other in the group. If yes from all, add this to the next team meeting. Start with pairs. Rotate to a new pair each meeting.
Do it in writing. Either: 
Each pair creates a shared doc that they use, following the same format above. Or
Create a group shared doc, and each pair puts their Feedback in the group doc. 
This requires pre-approval by every team member to view all Feedback as a gift and not feel shame if they receive brutal Feedback in this group setting. Be skeptical. Many will say yes when they mean no.

Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit ,"Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)


Video of Matt talking about how fear and anger give bad advice (3 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about a time fear and anger gave him bad advice (5 min)
The essence of my coaching is to prove to you that when you feel fear or anger, your brain gives you bad advice. Whenever you notice that you are experiencing fear/anger, therefore, my recommendation is that you do one of the following: 
""Shift"" out of fear/anger before deciding what to do. And in the meantime, take no action. 

OR


If there is urgency and you must act immediately (which is almost never the case), do exactly the opposite of what your brain is recommending. 
If you are in Anger, and your brain is telling you to crush this person who has wronged you, instead get curious about why they did what they did. 


This action does not mean that you don't subsequently end your relationship with this person. It just means that you first genuinely seek to understand why they did what they did. There are lessons there for you because you likely had a hand in creating the situation.


If you are in Fear, and you want to not do an action for fear of the perceived consequences (i.e., give someone blunt feedback), instead do the action (provide them with feedback ... in a kind way). 


Once again, it doesn't mean that there is no risk to the decision. It's just likely that the benefit outweighs the risk. And that the unwanted outcome is likely not as dire as you imagine it to be.
Now, of course, you will be saying, ""Why? What proof do you have that my brain gives me bad advice when I am in anger or fear?"" The write-up below is my attempt to give you that evidence. But the best way is to try the suggestions above one time and see how things turn out. My prediction is that they will turn out well, and then you will not even need to read the rest of this write-up.
But in case you still want to read more ...
The pre-frontal cortex (located in the frontal lobe) is the part of our brain that is generally credited for problem-solving and creative thought. The amygdala (situated near the basal stem and often referred to as ""the reptile brain"") is that part of our brain which generates the emotion of fear or Anger (when presented with new, risky, or threatening stimuli).
In his book The Righteous Mind, John Haidt argues convincingly that human thought starts with an emotion. We react to external stimuli with an emotion (joy, sadness, fear, etc.). Then our powerful brain comes up with a story or perceived-fact pattern that explains our feelings. Once we create this story, confirmation bias causes us to see facts that further support our story, only hardening our belief in its ""truth.""
Emotions are valuable and intelligent signals for us. Fear signals that there is something new here or something potentially risky. It is helpful for us to be aware of that so that we don't proceed recklessly ahead. Similarly, anger signals that there is something that is potentially harming us or those around us. It is valuable for us to be aware of this so that we don't allow it to continue unabated. 
But that is where the intelligence of fear and anger ends. Our rational brain will create a story that justifies fear or anger. This story is usually a prediction that some horrible things will happen if we do an action (or don't do an action). The evolutionary value of fear is that it kept humans alive in a world where risk (the presence of a wild animal) or newness (an unknown berry) often led to death. By preventing humans from proceeding in those situations, fear kept humans alive. So whatever story the mind created to justify the fear contributed to keeping humans alive. A similar pattern existed for anger. 
That was then. In the modern world, the stories that fear creates do prevent us from acting. They do preserve our ego. But they also have a tremendous opportunity cost. By not acting, we never know if the board member that we do not have trust with would step down if we asked them, or whether the person in a critical role who is not performing well (but whom we think we cannot afford to have quit) would start performing if we gave them kind-hearted direct feedback.
When we encounter the unknown, fear predicts that something terrible will happen if we move forward. (Anger predicts that bad things will continue to happen unless we move forward.) But, by definition, we cannot be sure of what will happen in the future. There is a chance that something good will result from the action. If we think about that possibility for several minutes and allow ourselves to breathe deeply, fear often turns into excitement. 
And if we do move forward, we often discover that either our negative predictions don't materialize. Or, if they do, the result is still better than the current state. And when that happens, hopefully, we also have the thought: ""Fear (or anger) was giving me bad advice. I'm glad I didn't follow it.""
For a more thorough explanation of the above, please read Behave, or listen to the author's explanation in this video (1h13m).

If you are convinced that the above is true, you may be thinking: ""Yeah, but how do I catch myself? When I'm in fear or anger, I don't realize it at the moment. I act. It's only much later that I realize it.""
This awareness is a big challenge. You can spend years meditating, and it will provide marginal benefit in your ability to notice when you are in fear or anger. Or you can outsource this function to those around you. 
I far prefer the latter. I have asked everyone I live with (my wife and children) and work with to signal me when they perceive me to be in fear or anger. The words that seem to be the most effective with me are ""I perceive you to be in anger."" When I hear that, I can immediately stop. (By contrast, if they say ""You're in anger"" or ""Are you in anger?"", I feel more anger.)

If you are unconvinced that the writings above are accurate, there is a way to test them. Make a bet with someone. The next time someone perceives you to be in fear (this particular test works better with fear than anger), make a bet with them. Your brain will be making a prediction: ""If I do X, then Y will happen."" Their brain will be making a different prediction, Z, which is likely the opposite of Y. Then, do the action and see what happens. I posit that the other person will win the bet. 
I have made these bets hundreds of times with people that I perceive to be in fear. I have yet to lose. 

(This next idea comes from Regina Gerbeaux, COO at Mochary Method)
Fear Journaling

Or, if there is no one that you feel comfortable making a bet with, then make a bet with yourself.  To do this, create a Fear Journal.  Whenever you feel fear, or someone tells you that they perceive you to be in fear, write down what prediction your brain is making.  Do this regularly so that you are able to make many predictions.  Then, a week or a month or a year later, go back and read the predictions that you made.  See how many of them actually came true.  And if any came true, ask yourself if that outcome was actually negative. 
My posit is that very few, if any, of them will come true.  And those that do will actually turn out to be net positive.

Now you know the danger of acting on the thoughts generated by fear or anger.  Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)
Anger
Now you have a system for knowing when you are in Anger.
Hint: You ask those who are close to you (your colleagues, spouse, kids) to tell you when they perceive you to be in fear or Anger by saying, ""I perceive you to be in fear/anger.""
But how do you then shift out of Anger?
Time will often do the trick. But most of us can't afford a long time before needing our brains to function well, especially when we don't know how long it will take.
There are ways to speed the process up. Here is a very non-exhaustive list of ideas to shift out of Anger. None of these are magic pills. Each is something to experiment with. Find what works for you.
The key is to activate other parts of your brain besides your amygdala. You can do this by getting your brain to focus on something different than the singular perspective you have on this issue. Try ...
A new physical location
If you're sitting down, stand up.
If you're inside, go outside.
A new physical state
If you're still, go outside and start sprinting as fast as you can for 2 minutes.
A new mental state
If you are bombarded by continuous stimulation (as almost all of us are with constant messaging, alerts, screen time, meetings, calls, etc.), then go stimulation-free (turn off all messaging, alerts, screens, etc.). Get bored. Restoration and Creativity: how to achieve them (3 min)
A new perspective on the issue
Do The Work by Byron Katie
Give your feelings and thoughts full expression:
If you feel Anger, go into another room (or a car), grab a pillow and yell as loud as you can into that pillow for 30 seconds. 
Hopefully, the distance and the pillow will muffle the sound enough that no one else will hear you. Practice this first to make sure it's the case.
Keep a journal, and write your worst thoughts full of all the swear words in your head.
There are many other ways. These are just some things with which you can experiment. You only need one that works for you.  
Fear

Fear is less physical than anger, and therefore the shift moves are less physical and more mental.  The Work by Byron Katie works well here.  But for me, the most effective is to make actual predictions.  “If I do this, then x will happen.  And then what?  And then y will happen.  And then what?  And then z will happen ….”  I do this all the way to the end.  

I then either:


Write it down in a Fear Journal (see under “Fear Journaling”: Fear and Anger give bad advice)


I revisit later to see if the predictions came true or not.  They almost never do, certainly not in the net-negative way that I predicted.  Or …


Share my predictions with an accountability partner and ask them what predictions they make.  If we make differing predictions, we make a bet.  


If I am the person feeling fear, I almost always lose the bet.  Of course to see the results of the bet, I need to do the thing that I fear doing.  That requires a push.  But each time I go through this cycle, I need less and less of a push.

Once I lose such a bet or prediction, my mind starts to unwind its belief in the quality of advice that fear gives me.   This is a never-ending process, however, since fear will continue to try to re-assert itself.

Fear vs Joy (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZqiTrDF6bcQYa3UFEKTqkuyyTHJCI_rpd173VubJ64/edit ,"Fear vs Joy (3 min)
Fear is an excellent motivator. It fueled humanity in times of scarcity. And continues to do so now in times of abundance. 
Many of us fear failure, but even more of us fear being viewed as a failure. This fear of failure drives us to work maniacally to achieve. 
But as good a motivator as fear is, there is a better one: Joy. For proof of this, find someone who has achieved joy in their work-life (admittedly, they are rare) and ask them whether they are more motivated and more successful when fueled by fear. I'm sure you can guess their answer: Far more motivated, far more successful, and most importantly … feeling peaceful and satisfied all day every day. 
This path, of course, sounds like something reserved for only those who already have made it financially. And there certainly is a high correlation to those who achieve this state with prior financial success, but that is not causation. It is merely a forcing function. 
Most people dream of financial success. They tell themselves: ""When I achieve wealth, all will be well. I will be happy; life will be good."" Then they achieve financial success, but no happiness, peace, or satisfaction arrives. It exposes this dream as a false one. Now, these people have no choice but to go in search of peace elsewhere. Some of them eventually find their ""purpose"" and experience true and lasting joy, satisfaction, and peace for the first time in their lives.
When hearing this, people say: ""But if I lose fear, won't I simply decide that making money is pointless and then go sit on a beach for the rest of my life?"" The answer is: ""If you're not careful about how you transition from fear to joy, then yes.""
I view Fear and Joy as motivation mountains. If you lose Fear before you discover Joy in your work, then you will indeed fall into a motivation valley and may not have any motivation to continue at work. It is then quite possible to get stuck there and not be able to climb out.
The key, therefore, is to discover Joy in your work first. The best way that I know to do this is the Energy Audit. Once you are experiencing Joy at work daily, it is safe to move on to losing Fear. And the best ways to lose Fear that I know of are Consciousness Training options.  (The link is currently only available to those whom I coach due to sensitive information.)
What welcomes you on the other side of this effort is daily Joy (even bliss) at work and in all of your life, as well as a massive success, because you will continue in your work for decades and decades, which in the end will bring far more success and a short fear-fueled sprint.
Enjoy!

Btw, if you currently find yourself in a motivation valley, all is not lost. There is a way out. It is the Energy Audit. But you may not have much that gives you energy. That's OK. Do the exercise regularly, and you will begin to discover things that provide you with energy. At first, a little bit of energy, and then later massive amounts of it.
","Fear is a strong motivator, but joy is even better for long-lasting success and satisfaction in work and life."

Receiving
Frequent, transparent feedback is critical for building a strong culture and a thriving business. Feedback is instrumental in building trust. Without trust, communication breaks down. Building a culture of feedback and transparency starts and ends with the founders.
Critical feedback, in particular, should be cherished. Your team members are in the trenches every day. They have knowledge about the company that you do not have. Only if you open up the door to negative feedback will your team feel comfortable giving it. 
Think about it from the other side—it can be quite scary to criticize someone who has power over them. They might feel they're risking their job! 
If you do not proactively collect feedback, you will quickly find the following problems emerge:
You will be in the dark about your company's problems: If you act defensively every time your team brings up an issue, they will soon stop bringing that valuable information to you, and you will wither away in your ivory tower.
Operations will grind to a halt: When people cannot share things openly, communication breaks down; when communication breaks down, operations slow. This problem only gets worse as your company grows, and as it grows, it becomes even harder to change that culture.
Your best talent will leave you: A-players have no patience for defensiveness and amateurishness. If you aren't mature enough to listen to your people, face your problems, and work on fixing them, your A-players will find the founders who listen.
Therefore, if you are to receive real, honest feedback and improve and keep your team communicating, YOU must make an effort to seek it out. Do so using the five A's:
1. Ask for it: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished but cherished. It is essential to say this, preferably in a one-on-one setting. When asking for feedback on the company in general, it is helpful to ask, ""If you were CEO, what would you change?"" You can do this in person or through an anonymous survey. 
When asking for feedback about himself as a manager, Lachy Groom, formerly of Stripe, asks, ""What feedback are you afraid to give because you think it will hurt my feelings? Please tell me that."" Even then, many people hesitate. I like to add, ""Don't tell me. Please think about it. Do you have it in your brain chamber? Yes? Now please tell me."" 
Let your reports know that until they share truly negative feedback with you, you will think that they are simply withholding, and you won't be able to trust them fully. 
Note: It is not enough to say, ""Give me feedback anytime."" None of your reports will ever actually create the time and space to do this. Instead, you must create this time and space. I do so in the last 5-10 minutes of every meeting I am in, whether 1-1 or team meeting. And I do it in writing (I ask each participant to write down their feedback to me in real-time in our shared Doc) so that I can refer back to it forever. I recommend that you do the same.
Many meeting owners send a survey after the meeting asking for feedback. Please recognize that this is close to useless. People will not carve out the time to do so. And will not be motivated to give honest feedback as they have no idea if it will be read or understood. 
2. Acknowledge it. Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say ""Yes,"" you can proceed. If they say ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""
If you want to go to the advanced level, also describe the emotions they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the feeling yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they are fearful that if they say what they think, you will get angry (and then become vindictive). So they have toned down their thought when saying it. If you tone it down even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will be safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""
What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
This action is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is more impactful than acting on their feedback.
To confirm that you have done this correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""
3. Appreciate it. Simply say ""Thank you"" for the precious gift that your colleague is giving you. Don't make excuses. Don't argue back. Just say, ""Thank you.""
4. Accept it (or not). Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback. You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not take (i.e., that you disagree with philosophically). If so, explain why. If you do accept it, however, then …
5. Act on it. Co-create an action item that will effectively address the feedback. Put a due date on it. Do it. And then let the feedback-giver know that you did the action. When you do, you will have completed the feedback loop. And the feedback-giver will then have gained trust that you want feedback and are committed to improving. Publish this feedback and action item widely to the organization. Only then will your team members feel confident that you hear their voices and safe enough to give you further feedback.
Giving 
First, when giving feedback, it is critical to use a two-way communication method (in person is best, a video call is okay, an audio call is least good). This method is so that you can see the person's reaction. If they get defensive and angry, you will be able to see that and say: ""I didn't intend to make you feel angry. I intended to be helpful."" This step will hopefully mollify their anger.
If, on the other hand, you use a one-way communication method (email, text, voicemail), then the recipient can quickly become defensive and angry without you realizing it. And because you don't notice the anger, you won't be able to address it. Unaddressed, that anger will soon turn into resentment towards you. Therefore, do NOT use a one-way communication method (email, text, voicemail) to give feedback unless it is 100% positive. There is one exception to this rule: If you already know (without a doubt) the person to be open, curious, and desirous of critical feedback.
Second, it is critical to always affirm the positive value of the relationship (i.e., ""I value you because you …"" or ""I like that you did ....""). Yes, every time you give someone feedback. 
Third, before giving critical feedback, write it down first (on a doc only you have access to). Why? Because in the moment, it is often challenging to give clear critical feedback. We feel fear, our brain tells us to withhold (after all, we like this person and don't want to hurt their feelings), and then we often can't get the message across fully or clearly. 
Fourth, phase in the way that you give critical feedback. In the first few meetings where you give critical feedback (after you have affirmed the relationship), give it verbally (i.e., read your notes). As you give feedback, watch the person. If you see that they become tense or get triggered … stop. Reassure them that your intent is not to criticize or attack. Rather you value them and want them to succeed to their fullest potential. Do not continue until they release their fear or anger (which can take a few days).
Once a person can appreciate verbal feedback, then in the next few meetings where you deliver critical feedback, copy/paste your feedback into a shared doc during the session and have them read it in front of you. Watch the person as they do. If they get triggered, stop them and reassure them that your feedback is intended as a gift.
Once the person can appreciate written feedback, you can move on to giving them feedback asynchronously. But know that this is a dangerous step. If they ever get triggered, you won't be able to see it and reassure them of your positive intent. Personally, I never share critical feedback asynchronously, no matter how open someone is. 
There are three levels of feedback that you can give:
Relative
Absolute
Deep (emotion-based)
Relative Feedback
This step is simple feedback that allows the recipient to gain confidence in what they are doing well, and hear steps to improve.
Here is the template:
Like. ""I like that you did …"" This should be an action that occurred, not a generic character trait. 
Good example: ""You said hello to me when I walked in the door yesterday.""
Bad example: ""You are nice.""


Wish That. ""I wish that you would do…."" Again, this should be a specific positive action. 
Good example: ""Say goodbye to me whenever you leave the room.""
Bad example: ""Don't be rude.""
Absolute Feedback
Matt talking about the importance of Absolute Feedback and how to give it (3 min)
People also need to know where they stand on an absolute basis. Do not wait until year-end Performance Reviews. Most people have constant anxiety when they aren't sure where they stand. Giving absolute feedback regularly (usually monthly in a 1-1) will eliminate this anxiety. Bad news is less anxiety-inducing than no news.
To give it, state:
Your current rating for your job function, 1-5, is … 
3 is “meeting expectations”
4 is “exceeding expectations”
5 is “OMG, it couldn’t be any better”
2 is “below expectation and I am now putting you on a written 30-day Performance Improvement Plan”
1 is “it couldn’t be any worse and I am now letting you go.”
What you did that I liked is ...
What you need to do to get to the next level is …

Absolute feedback:  example
Deep (emotions-based) Feedback
Finally, there is deep emotion-based feedback. Do this when there is more time (offsite).
Here is a template for providing this feedback, adapted from the book Nonviolent Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg.
Ask for permission. Give the receiver a little heads-up of what's coming. It can be enough to say 
""I have something to communicate to you, is now a good time?""


Do you value this relationship? If yes, please state why. 
""I value this relationship because …."", or
""I feel joy when I see you ....""


State your emotion in terms of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and excitement (feeling). This step is perhaps the most challenging part for you to do. Talking about your feelings might not be something you are used to, so it might be challenging at first. However, doing so is crucial for the other person to truly understand where you are coming from and take your feedback to heart. You may think, I'm not angry, I'm just frustrated. Well, that is just a lesser version of anger. Just as all colors are primarily red, yellow, and blue, all emotions are a version or mixture of the base emotions listed above.
""I feel anger."" |


State the facts as you perceive them (facts). Be very careful to state only pure facts, as a video camera would record them. (This is a challenge for many people to do. Keep it very short. If it is hard for you, simply skip this step and go right to Story.) An example of not fact: ""You disrespected me."" An example of fact: 
""You walked in the door this morning, and I did not hear you say hello.""


Now, state the thoughts, opinions, and judgments (Story) you have around this situation. 
""The thought that I have is ...."", or
""The story that I am telling myself is …."" 


If you want to go to the advanced level (see explanation in the next section below), describe what you did to create this situation. 
""I helped create this situation by ….""


Request what you would like to see. Try to frame it as positive action (""do x"") rather than a negative (""don't do y""). 
""I request that you ….""


Ask if the person accepts the feedback and the request. If yes, then hold them accountable for doing it.
Giving and receiving frequent and transparent feedback may be painful at first. Often when companies start implementing this, it brings up a lot of underlying resentment and repressed issues. However, if you hang in there, you will find that the amount and intensity of feedback diminish substantially, and your team will be noticeably happier and more productive. 
The next level of giving feedback (whether Relative, Absolute, or Deep) is recognizing your part in creating the situation. If you view each issue as caused by others or things outside of you, you will feel and act like a victim and give away your power to create the world you want to live. Conversely, if you are willing to articulate how you helped create the situation, you take back your control. You will more clearly see how you can change the current situation and prevent the situation from happening again in the future.
To do this, in Deep feedback, before making a request, state: ""I helped create this situation by …."" Then write out (or say) all the steps needed to create this situation. 
In conscious leadership terminology, we call this ""taking 100% responsibility.""
When you ask for feedback from someone for the first time, they may say, ""I have no critical feedback for you; you're great."" If so, then either they think you're perfect, or they are withholding from you. (Which one do you think it is?) In this case, you can supply the thought for them, and ask if you are close: ""I have a story in my head that you are feeling anger and the thought that you are having is 'Screw Jim, he never gives me clear written direction and then gets mad when things don't turn out the way that he had envisioned.' Is that close?"" This prompt will often get the person to say: ""Yes, that's right."" or ""No, what I'm actually thinking is ….""
One of the most common issues that I hear from Managers of why they don't want to give transparent feedback:
""Person X on my team is not performing well. But there is no one else that can do their job. I plan to hire someone to replace X eventually. But in the meantime, if I give X real and honest feedback, I am afraid that they will quit, and then I'll be totally screwed.""
This situation is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you do not give someone feedback, then, by definition, that person will fail.
If, however, you give feedback as a gift (using the script above), then the receiver will likely receive it well, and one of two magical things will happen:
They will work hard to improve and perform the way that you hope, or
They will admit that they cannot perform the job and actively help you find their replacement.
Withholding feedback is never the best answer!
A note on expressing feelings:
When you give clear feedback, the receiver may cry. This reaction is not a bad sign. For many people, crying is a very effective way of releasing emotion. Allow the person the space to cry. Be okay with it. Just breathe. Don't try to stop their crying or cut it off by talking to them or putting your hand on their shoulder. Instead, allow them to cry as long as they need to (rarely lasts more than 1-2 minutes). Once they finish, they will feel much better, and you can both proceed productively. 

If we make it not okay to cry, then people have no way of releasing their emotions, and then that emotion becomes a bad mood.
Mathilde Colin from Front has written up her advice on giving and receiving feedback. It is similar to what's written above, but there are valuable differences as well. 
Question: ""People tell me that I am too abrasive when I give feedback. How do I deliver feedback in a way that people are open to hearing it without feeling hurt?""
There have been several innovations in feedback delivery. 
The first was to share positive feedback before sharing any negative feedback. ""You did this thing really well. This other thing, however, was not good.""
The second was sharing what to do, as opposed to what not to do. ""The next time you do this action, please do it this way ….""
The third was to not state as judgments but rather share feelings, thoughts, and requests. ""When you did …, I felt frustrated,"" ""The thought that I had was….,"" ""My request is….""
Reed Hastings of Netflix has landed upon the latest (and IMHO best) iteration so far. When giving feedback, he does not act in anger, nor does he state how he feels. Instead, he says what he thinks needs to happen (positive example) and why it will lead to the company's success and the person's success (rather than Reed himself no longer feeling anger). 
To me, therefore, best practice is
State what the person is doing that you like
State what other thing you would like to see the person do, in positive terms (""Please do this,"" not ""Don't do that"")
Explain why this way of doing things will lead to the company and person's success","Feedback is crucial for trust and business success. Giving and receiving feedback effectively involves asking, acknowledging, appreciating, accepting, and acting on it."

If you want to receive accurate, honest feedback and improve and keep your team communicating, YOU must make an effort to seek it. 
Do so using the five A's:
1. Ask for it: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished but cherished. It is essential to say this to them explicitly. 
But that alone is not enough.  You need to actively pull feedback from each person. They will be reluctant to share at first. 
For them, it is an asymmetric bet in the negative direction. If you take the feedback well, you will positively change your behavior, resulting in a +1. If, however, you accept the feedback badly, then you may become vindictive and try to destroy the person, which for them would be a negative 100. Most rational people will not make this wager. 
Therefore, you must be creative in extracting negative feedback for the first time so that you get a chance to prove that you will receive it well.
Lachy Groom recommended a feedback method that I use often. I ask the person: ""Please don't say it, just think it. What is the thought you have that you are afraid to tell me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Again, please don't say it; just think about it. Do you have it in your brain chamber?"" If they respond ""Yes,"" then I say, ""OK, now please say it.""
I also let my reports know that I will think that they are simply withholding until they share negative feedback with me, and I won't fully trust them. 
It would not be enough for me to say, ""Give me feedback anytime."" None of my reports would ever actually create the time and space to do so, as it feels aggressive to push for this agenda item. Instead, I must carve out this time and space. I do so in the last 5-10 minutes of every meeting, whether 1-1 or team meeting. And I do it in writing (I ask each participant to write down their feedback to me in real-time in our shared Doc) so that I can refer back to it forever. And once they do give me this negative feedback, I then create a recurring space for them to give it to me from then on. I recommend that you do the same.

2. Acknowledge it. Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what your colleague said or wrote. Put yourself in their perspective, and say it as if you are them talking to you. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say ""Yes,"" you can move on. If they say ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have summarized what they said correctly, you can even go deeper by saying, ""There’s more.

3. Appreciate it. Say ""Thank you"" for the precious gift that your team is giving you. Don't make excuses. Don't argue back. Just say, ""Thank you.""
4. Accept it (or not). Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback.  If you had to accept all feedback, it would become tyranny of the feedback-giver.  And we never want that.

You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not accept (i.e., that you disagree with philosophically). If so, please explain why.  Bring us into your world.  Make us see why this feedback doesn’t make sense for you.

Firing Well (updated) (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit ,"Firing Well (updated)

When you do fire someone, put yourself in their shoes. It is a devastating event emotionally. And it is a real setback financially. Your team will also be watching closely to see how you treat ex-employees: a vindictive attitude will make everyone feel unsafe!
Put real effort into helping the person find their next job, and quickly. Give them a severance package that gives them enough time to find another job and have the pay begin realistically. This package is two months minimum, but more realistically, three months or more. And then help them find work within that time frame.
Because you value transparency, make an announcement to the company about the person's departure, or allow the person to do it themselves. When you make the announcement, DO NOT blame or criticize the person. Instead, praise the person's contributions to the company, and take ownership yourself for the fact that you weren't able to match their skills to the company's needs. Either you didn't evaluate well during the recruiting process, or you didn't onboard and train well. Take responsibility for the situation, and explain what you are doing to ensure it doesn't happen again.
It is highly likely that you will be feeling anger toward this person. 
You value the rest of your team much more highly than this person. You will not want to give the person an extra penny. You will want to save those resources for the team that remains that is performing. 
You likely also think, ""This person is a liability. I don't ever want to be associated with this person, and I wouldn't want them associated with my name ever again.""
Feel this anger, and then let it pass. 
Recognize that you have a responsibility here. Your recruiting, training and management helped create this situation. It is your responsibility to help the person find a job and a better fit company. If you want to save your company's resources, then help them find that job more quickly. And then turn to your recruiting, training, and managing processes, and ask yourself: ""What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""
Recognize that this person did not have the skills or behaviors you needed, but they have passions. Find out what those passions are. Behind those passions are likely excellent skills. Help the person determine what role (it may not be in the business world) would be a great fit for them. What would their dream job be? Then become their agent, and help them land that dream job. Do exactly what an agent does:
Interview them to discover what their ideal role is. Match that ideal against your knowledge of their skills/passions to actual roles available to determine a real job that they would enjoy and be good at.

Create a written description of the person and their talents. If OKed by the person, post it on your social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) with your written endorsement of the candidate. Ask interested employers to contact the person directly. 
Offer to send a message of recommendation if the candidate gets past a first-round interview at a company. Use LinkedIn to discover who you know at that company.
I have found that the message of endorsement works one time and usually moves the candidate to the next stage. You can either use the bullet to get the candidate an interview or use it after the first interview to land them the job itself. The latter is much more valuable.
If you do this, not only will you be doing the right thing and taking responsibility for your actions, but you will also create a culture of safety in your company. 
It will put your remaining team at ease (allowing them to perform better at their job), and news of this culture will spread quickly so that soon your Glassdoor reviews will rise. This action, in turn, will make your company a far more desirable place to work, and your rate of offer acceptance will go up dramatically.


It will ease pressure during the recruiting process. If you and your team know that you have a humane approach to letting people go, you can take a bit more risk on people with great potential but little experience during the recruiting process. And those often end up being the best performers.


It will allow you to let underperformers go sooner because you won't dread the trauma of the firing process. There will be no trauma. 


You may even go to the Jack Welch model outlined here: Comms, Internal: Announcing traumatic events
Yes, doing the right thing often pays for itself several times over!
I call the process above ""Firing Well."" If you learn how to do it, you benefit from a happier culture, a bolder hiring process, and a much more effective performance management system. All of these will strengthen your team and your company.

How to announce to the person?
First, read Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min).
Let the person know …
This will be a difficult conversation.  You will likely feel sadness, anger and fear.
I am letting you go.  
This decision is not changeable
This is why 
Here is what I did to create this situation
I am going to help you in the following ways 
I will be your agent in finding your next job
I am giving you ___ months severance, which they will receive upon …
Transferring key information back to the company
Signing your offboarding documents
Today is your last day (unless more time is required to transfer key information)
The reason for this is that it minimizes the time that everyone lingers in the sadness of saying goodbye.  
The remainder of today is hopefully enough time to say goodbye.
After hearing this, I imagine that you are feeling anger, fear and sadness.  Would you be willing to share your thoughts with me?
(Repeat back what they share with you.  This helps reduce their anger from dangerous levels.)
How to announce to the company?
Any change in the organizational structure, be it terminations or reporting changes, causes trauma to the organization. And anytime there is the potential for trauma, it is essential to:
Be transparent with the entire organization


Give each person a chance to release their fear or anger
To do this:
Announce the org change in the group meeting (usually All Hands)
Schedule 1-1s for each person shortly after the group meeting. These can be the regularly-scheduled 1-1s that each manager has with their reports.


Have each manager directly ask each report in the 1-1 if they feel fear or anger about the org change. If they are, allow them to fully release their thoughts and feelings.  See Heard: how to make people feel it (2 min) for how to do this.

Fundraising - late-stage:  Brand or Price? (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I7BXtJHbo-21PFD3Kasn0P6USFZL3cJTvm989tt0peI/edit ,"Fundraising - late-stage:  Brand or Price? (3 min)

""Matt, I already have two brand name investors in my Series A and B. Now it is my Series C. Should I continue to optimize for a brand (lower value) or simply go for highest price (non-value-add)?""
Each time you take money at a lower value, you are ""buying"" that investor. First, calculate exactly how much it costs, measured in equity dilution. If you take in $100mm at $1b or $100mm at $2b, you are paying an extra 5% of equity given away to buy the brand investor. What are you getting for that 5%? 
In the beginning, you likely need one brand to simply validate the value of the Series A itself so that you can recruit. That firm may or may not add value. Still, you likely need them for validation reasons, akin to the positive signaling for an individual who has gone to Stanford or MIT or worked at Google or Amazon.
After that, however, the brand's value is only tied to the actual work that they will do for you. You are not more validated if you went to both Stanford and MIT. Either one of them is enough to signal your academic prowess. In the same way, a second brand name investor doesn't increase your validation. So, they have to earn their entry with actual value-added. 
The best way to determine whether or not they will add value is to ask them to do so … before deciding who to take money from. The hardest that investors will ever work is to win a deal. Take advantage of that. Ask each of the investors that you are considering to do real work for you. This can go on for months. (I have known founders that have done this for six months before choosing.) The investors also don't mind doing this work. It actually turns the bake-off into something that feels more of a meritocracy, which almost all prefer (at least those who are willing to do work). 
When considering an insider-led round vs. taking in an outsider, know that you are not getting any new blood, and therefore any new value-add by doing an insider-led round, but are getting something likely even more valuable than that: no additional investor to deal with. 
Let's be clear, most investors over the long-term are net negative. In the beginning, they may add value, but as time goes on, they no longer do and yet continue to have lots of opinions and need to be catered to. Every new investor has some vote (whether through shares or board seat). And every person says ""yes"" when they like a person, and ""no"" when they don't. So, you have to maintain a positive relationship with every new investor. And that takes time. The safest method is to have regular 1-1s with that investor to make them feel heard. And those 1-1s should happen at least quarterly, if not monthly. As you start to add more investors, you can see how the overhead of these 1-1s starts to add up. And this is time that you are not spending on the business itself. 
So, any new investor at this stage must add real value. The question then becomes: How much will it cost? What value do they need to add to make that cost worthwhile? 
The cost is easily calculable. You simply look at the dilution from the higher price and compare it to the dilution from the lower price (from the brand firm). The difference is the equity cost. 

Now you can answer the second question. If you hired an advisor for the amount of equity, what would you need them to do? You would do reference checks to see if that advisor had delivered that kind of value in the past. You would also have an explicit written document of the value that you expect the advisor to deliver. (With an advisor, you have the added advantage that you can end the agreement if the advisor doesn't deliver on the agreement and end the vesting there. Unfortunately, there is no enforcement other than reputation with an investor, which isn't a powerful tool.)
If you cannot justify the equity giveaway, you go with the most passive money out there. But don't think that high price and non-brand means passive. There are quite a few high-price firms that are known to be quite painful. Do your diligence there as well to see who is non-painful, non-intrusive, etc. 
Also, for some high-signal investors (like Sequoia Growth), many public markets and crossover investors simply ""follow Sequoia."" What discount you give to Sequoia, you may well get back in a higher-priced next round. ","Founder debates brand vs. price for Series C fundraising. Brand investors cost equity, must add value; high price doesn't guarantee value."
Fundraising- The Relationship Method (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/163t4I3CzQ-CUScBYp6fCxpboSgHxCB7syd4Jtzw7nco/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Fundraising: The Relationship Method (8 min)
Introductions
The introduction is a vital part of the fundraising process, and you only get one chance at it. I recommend using the Triangulation Method.
When you want to be introduced to an investor, first find three to five people in your network who know that person. Then ask each to send an email to the target investor, letting her know how great they think you are, and highly recommending that she meet with you. After receiving several such emails, the investor will proactively reach out to you. She has received recommendations before, but never three or more for the same person. She concludes that you and your company must be truly great, so she is already inclined to invest in you before she even meets you.
From your side, stack all of the referrals in a short period (within a week). You are trying to achieve critical mass and have your referrals rise above the noise of other referrals. 
It's important not to hand each referrer the same potential text to send onward. If they end up sending the same language, then the referrals are revealed to be orchestrated by you. Therefore, either give your referrers different suggested language or no suggestion at all.
Two Methods
There are two ways to raise money: the Traditional Method and the Relationship Method.
The Traditional Method is when you pitch an investment firm with your story, most often with a slide deck, describing the customer problem, solution, market size, unit economics, financial projections, competition, team members, traction, go-to-market strategy, and so on. You might run through your presentation dozens of times before you find a spark of interest in either you or your company.
The Relationship Method is to build a trusting, friendly relationship with an investor before discussing what your company does. This process takes more time, but it dramatically increases the close rate. This strategy works because we are most often guided by our emotional responses no matter how rational we appear. We make instinctive, gut choices, and our rational brains do an excellent job of retrofitting logic over those choices.
The first time you talk about your company, the investor will decide whether or not she wants to invest. If she does not yet like or trust you, then your company had better be optically perfect—and more often than not, it isn't. So, the key is to wait to talk about your company until you are sure that the investor likes and trusts you personally. By then, the investor will have a positive bias toward you and will be inclined to invest in your company, warts and all. 

But how do you get the investor to like and trust you?
Build trust and like
Think about the people you like. Do you want people who just talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
When meeting potential investors for the first time, ask them about themselves. Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home. Ask them lots of questions. Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you. When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. It is heartwarming when we find someone who cares enough about the details of our lives to remember them.
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always appreciate that they took the time to meet with you.
But how do you get a meeting in the first place without the explicit purpose of talking about your company? You can use the Triangulation Method outlined above, but if you don't have enough mutual acquaintances, you can simply ask for it. Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""We only want to work with investors with whom we have a good relationship. So let's start with a coffee to get to know each other personally."" 
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the investor is likely to say yes. If you have truly allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be long, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
You can then talk about your company with the confidence that they are already inclined to invest. If you aren't good at reading body language, just wait. At some point, they will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to invest in you. Now tell me what your company does."" 
To summarize, the four keys are:
Ask them about their lives.
Prove that you heard by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""
Let them know what you appreciate about them.
If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond and have a willing investor.
When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a strong adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the method, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective investors and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.
Strengthening the Relationship
Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not everyone needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:
Matt,
Your old house, no??
Peter
http://www.sfgate.com/realestate/walkthrough/article/Soothing-style-welcoming-pool-patio-defines-11023844.php#photo-12599447
I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him. 
Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me. 
Below is another example, a message of appreciation, which comes from a Managing Partner at one of the most successful investment firms in the world. 
Hey Matt,
Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!
Bill
I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, Founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:
At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as ""the handwritten note guy.""
So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. Andy suggests making this a formal process—he says, ""Every day I review all my interactions and send (or schedule) thank you's as appropriate. It ensures I don't miss anyone and am prompt. And it takes literally a few minutes.""
Sell Yourself, Not Your Company
Cliff Weitzman, CEO of Speechify, realized that it was key to sell himself and not his company. If he could do so, he would gain investors for life—investors who would follow him through every pivot and company. So, when Cliff realized that he had established trust and like, he shared the story of his life—using a method that his brother Tyler had discovered.
Tyler Weitzman, CEO of BlackSMS, is a unique guy. He likes to research social situations. As an undergrad at Stanford, he explored a method for conveying one's achievements (or bragging, if you prefer!) while remaining humble and relatable. Through countless interviews of master storytellers, Tyler determined the ultimate structure for humbly telling one's story:
- Credit: ""It could not have happened without [name the others involved].""
- Hard Work: ""We had to put in so much to make it happen, for example, [describe the hard work].""
- Vulnerability: ""It was most difficult for me when….""
- Duty: ""Our dream drove us to [noble motive].""
- Gratitude: ""I am so proud and thankful that….""
I encourage you to tell your story to a friend using this exact structure. See what comes out. Ask your friend for her reaction. I think you will be amazed.
Here is an example of this method:
Acknowledgment
This book could not have happened without all the people that I have coached, and who coach me, including Chris Barber, Misha Talavera, Karissa Paddie, Ryan Breslow, Alex MacCaw, Naval Ravikant, Brian Armstrong, Tatiana Dorow, Alexander Kasser, and Stephen Mochary. 
We each had to put in so much to make this book happen. Chris Barber ""found"" me and invited me to coach his roommates at Stanford, which launched my coaching career. Misha,  Ryan and Alex, whom I coached, forced me to get these writings into the world. Naval read the draft and said it was the best business book he'd seen (whether true or not, that's what he told me), further encouraging me to get it out into the world. My wife, Tatiana Dorow, well, she just makes my life great by making me laugh each and every day. Alexander Kasser, my grandfather, made me feel that I could never fail, no matter how hard I swung the bat. And Stephen Mochary, my dad, has always been my best friend and biggest fan.
Writing this book was most difficult for me when it was almost done. I very much enjoyed writing the content. But the final stages of editing and formatting felt like ""work."" Luckily, Alex pushed me through those tasks.
As a group, what drove us was our dream of sharing this information with the world so that CEOs and companies could be more efficient and effective. 
I am so proud and thankful that I got a chance to work with this amazing group of people. My wish for you is that you, too, get the chance to experience the joy of coaching others one day. It is the most deeply satisfying activity that I have yet found in life. (If you know of anything more satisfying, please let me know!)","The article discusses the Relationship Method in fundraising, emphasizing building trust and relationships with investors before discussing your company."
Goals: how to create and review (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5ak38pEg7fZE5H2INOzUHHZJTW9QAB8aobQJW5Uyek/edit?usp=sharing ,"Goals: how to create and review
Video of Matt explaining how to create goals.

Goals, how to create them

When creating goals, the key thing to think about is outcomes. What are the outcomes, that if they occurred, you would say to yourself, “I crushed it in my role!”?

Then you need to pick the timeframe by which you’d like for each outcome to occur.  I usually track each goal to complete by the end of the current quarter, but it could be the current year,  month, or week.

And finally, you need to prioritize.  If you could only get one goal done, which would it be?  This becomes your #1 goal.  


I recommend never tracking more than 3 work goals and 1 personal goal.  Best to track only 1 goal however, as you will then truly focus on it.


If you do track 3 work goals, then each goal should touch a different part of your organization, so you’ve got coverage across the entire organization.



Next Actions, how to create them

Once you have created goals, the next step is to create the next action needed to accomplish each goal.

Goals are outputs or outcomes.  They are occurrences that happen in the world.  

But each action needs to be an input, meaning something you have control over entirely.

Here are examples of outputs and inputs.  If the goal is: 


“Achieve $5mm ARR by the end of the current quarter.”
The next action could be:
“Close X customer”.  This is an output.  You DO NOT entirely control this action.  The customer must decide to buy your product.  Or …
“Send a proposal to X customer”.  This is an input.  You DO entirely control this action.  

You want to write all next actions as inputs, things that you control entirely.  This ensures that you are never waiting on someone else to take the next action. You can always create forward momentum.

Next, you want to make the timeframe for the next action as short as possible.  What can you do in the next 2 minutes?  If you can figure that out, then you can do it immediately.  This again ensures that forward momentum is created immediately. 

Here is an example of next actions with longer and shorter timeframes:


Send a proposal to X customer.
This requires 2 hours.  First I have to write up the proposal, then I have to send it.
The first 2 minutes of this action are to find and schedule the 2 hours needed to write the proposal.  So, I could instead write the next action as …


Schedule 2 hours to write and send the proposal.
This takes less than 2 minutes.  I can complete it immediately.  
This leads to traction and motion before even finishing your updating/planning process.

Once you write an action in a way that it takes 2 minutes or less, please do it IMMEDIATELY.   Now the flywheel of momentum has already begun.  This is the definition of BIAS TO ACTION.

Goals, how to review them

On a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly or monthly), it is important to review your Goals, assess the status, and declare your next actions toward each goal.  This is important to hold yourself accountable, and to share your accountability with your team.

To do so, follow this script:
Goal 1: Product: 
Status: On Track
Good:


Not Good:


Next Actions:


Goal 2: Profit: 
Status: On Track
Good:


Not Good:


Next Actions:


Goal 3: People: 
Status: On Track
Good:


Not Good:


Next Actions:


Goal 4: Personal: 
Status: On Track
Good:


Not Good:


Next Actions:


Next Actions should answer one of two questions:
“What can I do to fix the Not Good?” or
“What can I do to advance toward the Goal?”
","Create goals with clear outcomes, timeframes, and priorities. Break them into actionable steps you control. Review regularly for progress."
Gratitude (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kCULxudhpoSZNN-5m4G611YGNI92aZA-xrMjbF0juA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Gratitude (3 min)
Confirmation bias is the phenomenon that we will discover evidence to support whatever belief we start with. A corollary to this is that whatever question we ask, we will focus on the answer. 
In any situation, we can ask ourselves, ""What is wrong here?"" or ""What is right here?"" Throughout our lives, parents, teachers, and employers have taught us to ask the former question. We cannot fault them. They had the best intentions. In the earliest years of our life, they were trying to keep us alive. Unfortunately, an unintended consequence is that we learned to focus on the negative, so we continually see the negative. This leads to objectively very successful people being not fully satisfied with their lives, themselves, etc. If that is where it ended, I wouldn't touch it, as this book is about becoming a great CEO, not about maximizing a feeling of fulfillment. However, that is not where it ends.
It turns out that we perform our best when we are having fun and feeling good about ourselves. 
If you want proof of this, go to any kid sports event where you know the kids' names. Start cheering positively for the losing team, with specific compliments to specific kids: ""Great pass Jimmy."" ""Way to be in position, George."" When a kid takes a shot but misses … ""Good idea Joey, it was the right thing to do."" Within 5-10 minutes, the game's tide will start to change toward the team that you are giving specific compliments to. (I have done this many times. And it has worked every time!)
So, how do we take advantage of this knowledge to generate a good feeling in ourselves? We ask the right question: ""What is good about this situation?"" ""What is good about this team member?"" ""What is good about my company?"" ""What is good about my life?"" Or, we fill in the overarching statement: ""I am grateful for ________."" 
I recommend making this a daily practice. I do it first thing every morning. To remember to do it, create a trigger for yourself. 
A trigger is something that you will see at the time that you want to do the action. The most effortless trigger, in this case, is a piece of paper with the word ""Gratitude"" printed on it, taped to your night-table, or wall by your bed, or mirror in your bathroom. When you see it each morning, you say the phrase ""I am grateful for __"" five times with a different ending each time. (You don't have to say it out loud; you can say it in your mind.) Using a trigger allows you to create a habit easily. 
Another way to make this a regular habit is to use a journal like The Five-Minute Journal. Keeping the book by your bedside is the trigger, as you will see it when you wake up and just before you go to sleep. 

If you do this gratitude practice regularly (don't worry if you miss days here and there), your view of your life and yourself will begin to change for the better. And soon afterward, you will start to perform better in life, just like the kids on the sports field.
For the cynics out there, being grateful doesn't mean that you will suddenly ignore all of the areas of your life or your company that could use improvement. Just the opposite. It only means that you will bring an attitude of joy instead of desperation when addressing those areas. 
Life and company-building don't have to be complicated or painful. Daily gratitude helps us realize that.","Confirmation bias leads us to focus on what we ask. Practicing gratitude daily improves outlook, performance, and joy in life."

Everyone needs an organizational system to track goals, priorities, and tasks. Most successful CEOs that I know use the approach outlined in the book Getting Things Done: The art of stress-free productivity by David Allen. While the book is dense, it is worth reading in its entirety. The essence of Allen's system is:
Each day, process every item in your Inbox (defined broadly as all Inboxes [email, text, Slack, Jira, etc.] and all to-do's). If the action takes <2 minutes to complete, do it immediately. If not, then write down what the necessary action is, and place it one of the following lists: 
1. Next Actions: These are the next tasks on your priority list separated into areas of context. 
Computer (tasks where you need access to your computer)
Calls (you can complete these when you don't have access to a computer, e.g., riding in a car)
Outside (tasks that can only be achieved outside, such as errands)
Home (functions that you can only complete at home). 
You should write tasks as single actions (as opposed to broad goals). The key is not to think about what needs to be done once you write down the Next Action. You should write The Next Action so clearly that all you need to do is follow its direction when you read it next.

Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about or responding to one-off issues in real-time. A much more efficient method is to batch your issues and discuss them all at once. This method does not apply to urgent matters. You need to address those immediately. But by addressing many issues regularly, soon critical issues will disappear.

Video of Matt explaining Heard:  how to make people feel it (4 min)

When people have a feeling or thought, they want to feel heard. If they don't, they will feel resentment. 
So, how do you make people feel heard? By listening deeply and then actively acknowledging what they say (or even better, what their actual thoughts are).
First, get ready to feel triggered (i.e., anger, fear, sadness). Tell yourself that if these emotions come, they are going to give you bad advice. Instead, imagine a glass case around the person that you are talking to. Anything they say is not going to leave that glass case. None of it hits you.  (This is a critical step, because if you do get triggered, you will not be able to make the person feel heard.  In fact, you will do the opposite.)
Second, ask the person to express what their feelings and thoughts are. Really be present with the person you’re listening to. Put away any distractions. Make it your entire intention to listen fully to understand, not to talk/respond right away.
Third, acknowledge what they said by …
If they are trying to give you feedback (or are simply getting angry at you), then ...
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 

Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  
You can keep going deeper and deeper by repeating this process until the person says “No, that’s it.”  If you allow the person to go all the way down to the core issue, they usually have an ah-ha moment that almost resolves the issue on its own.
If you want to go to the advanced level when repeating back, also describe to them the feeling they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the emotions yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they fear you will get angry if they say what they really think (and then become vindictive). So they have toned down their thought when saying it. If you tone it down, even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will be safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""


What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
Again, say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  (There is almost always more!)
After the above process is complete, to confirm that you have done it correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""

        2. If they are sharing a painful thing that is going on in their life ...
Don't repeat back what they said. Instead, say, ""I imagine that you are feeling …."" And then honestly try to imagine what they are feeling and thinking. Express that. 
""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you can even go deeper by asking …
 ""Is there more?""  Or even better …
“There’s more.  Please tell me more.”  Because there is almost always more! 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Please tell me more.""

What if someone won't say what they are feeling or thinking? No worries, you can still make them feel heard. You have to imagine what they are thinking and say that. ""I imagine that you are thinking something like …."" And then, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done.
If they say, ""No,"" ask them what their thoughts are. Now that they have seen that you won't get angry, they are more likely to share. 
If they still don't share, you can try to imagine their thoughts again. Repeat until they do share and you have reflected it correctly.

This is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is more impactful than acting on their feedback, or helping them solve their problem.

Conversely, if you feel that someone you are talking to is not hearing you, you can simply ask them:  “To make sure that I am communicating well, can you please repeat back what you heard me say.”   If that feels too blunt, you can first share with them this document.

Hiring Execs: External vs Internal (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaknANyT2UJC0YMF6zYnErMp4imlslDbPmg-d9yeGlI/edit ,"Hiring Execs: External vs Internal (2 min)
As a company hits PMF (Product Market Fit) and begins to scale quickly, there is tremendous pressure to hire ""real execs"" to run each major department. By now, the dangers of hiring overqualified people into these roles are well-documented. The conventional wisdom is that you want to hire people who match the role's requirements for the next 12-18 months, not the period beyond that, as suggested by Elad Gil. But I want to introduce a far-more-radical and far-less-popular view:
Hiring externally is a failure of training! Executives are nothing more than managers of managers. And there is only one set of training that every manager needs to become an exec: How to manage well. In addition, there is a massive benefit from providing this training internally: all of your execs and managers will use a similar management system, and therefore the company as a whole will operate as one unified team, rather than disparate teams tied together by a company name only. See Scaling: Hire a ""Manager Trainer"" as COO
Certain areas require functional expertise: Legal, Engineering, Finance/Accounting. But do not be fooled that when you hire an experienced lawyer as your General Counsel, a skilled engineer as your VP Engineering, and an experienced accountant or investment banker as your CFO, that you are also hiring an excellent manager. It is a rare case when you are doing so. 
In addition, existing team members are entirely known quantities. You see if they exhibit the behaviors you want (culture), whether they understand the details of your business, and whether you plain like them. External hires are rarely a perfect culture match, often take months if not years to truly understand your business, and if you end up not liking them personally you will not spend the necessary time with them to fully train them on how you want them to operate. 
I coach many highly successful late-stage companies. When I ask the CEOs who their top exec team members are, the names that I hear are often promoted internally. 
So, before you hire external executives, build a manager training program. If you have to hire externally for a person to run this program, so be it. Give them the title COO. Make it clear that their primary job function is to train all of the company's managers.
This function was Sheryl Sandberg's gift to Facebook. You deserve the same.
","Hiring external execs is seen as a training failure. Internal promotions align teams better, emphasizing manager training for executive roles."

Step 3:  “differentiated value”:  So what?  Why do these differentiators matter?  What is the value this feature enables?
Go through the list.  You’ll find 2-3 buckets of “value themes” that are created for your customers.


Step 4:  best-fit customers:  what does this customer in particular care about most from these “value themes”?
What are the characteristics of the people who care about this product?
Sell them on these points.  Customers will care about different things, so having different value themes helps make the sale better.

How to GIVE Feedback like an Obnoxious Jerk (by Alexis d'Amecourt),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lA4Bigmee4b_P7GjiXJzN0oZ4pzz536LHNqaqNZaYcU/edit ,"How to GIVE Feedback like an Obnoxious Jerk	
By Alexis d’Amecourt

As Marty McFly walked into the crowded conference room, Biff Tannen bellowed, “Hey, look everyone, Marty’s fly is down!” Now, some may argue that Biff, while being obnoxious and aggressive, provides direct and actionable feedback. 

However, to avoid being a Biff, feedback should come from a place of compassion and a genuine desire to help your colleague improve. 

In ‘No Rules, Rules’, Reed Hastings & Erin Meyer reveal two superpowers that Netflix employees effectively use to give constructive feedback. 

Assist

Give feedback to assist, not to bring someone down. An example of the latter would be providing feedback to voice frustration or furthering a political agenda. Hence why giving feedback when feeling anger and fear is a bad idea. 

The goal of feedback is to help a person improve; otherwise, don’t give it. 

Like my Austrian grandmother used to say, “If you ain’t got nothing nice to say, keep your Von Trapp shut.”

Feedback should be a GIFT to the person and, therefore, the company.

Actionable

Focus your feedback on what your colleague can improve. 

When Biff gave feedback to Marty, he stopped before the most crucial part. By just yelling, “Marty’s fly is down!” Biff’s feedback stops before it becomes actionable.

Biff would have been more effective and more compassionate if he had said in a low voice, “Marty, I am sure you will want to know… your zipper is down. I want you to know because when we are with clients, we will have a much better chance of closing the deal if we are presentable. ”

It’s not always possible to give actionable advice, but the effort to include information that can ensure the receiver is on a path to improving is critical.

Taking the time and effort to make actionable feedback shows that you genuinely care about your colleague. 

Don’t be Biff. ","Feedback should be compassionate and aimed at helping, not tearing down. Give actionable advice to genuinely assist in improvement."
How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bF88nIzZGJT9NTDXK6IR1ZzRCBqYMr8NK_No8nM0aI/edit ,"How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min)

As CEO, it is critical to have a personal connection with your team. They need to know that you care about them before they care about the work they do for you. 
When in the office, this personal connection is relatively easy to maintain. You say hello to them each morning and goodbye to them each evening when you leave. You see them at lunchtime and ask them about their lives. 
But how do you maintain that connection when there are no informal in-person interactions that serve as prompts to say these ""hellos,"" ""goodbyes,"" and ""what is going on in your life""? 
Create your own prompts.
First, get to know some personal information about each person on your team (the name of their spouse, their children, their pets, where they grew up, what they like to do for fun).  You can create a Personal Info, Team - example (1 min) and ask people to enter their information there.
Then, schedule some time each week (I recommend one hour per week) to reach out to various members of your community (work team, investors, family, friends) and let them know that you are thinking of them. The message need not be long. The only intent is to let them know that you are thinking about them.
Here are some examples:
""Thinking of you. Hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke are doing well.""
""I saw this article on tennis and thought of you.""
That's it. The message need not be long nor elaborate. The only purpose is to let your colleague know that you are thinking about them and remember the important things about their life. 
It takes very little time, and it is massively effective. 
You are likely thinking: ""Matt, this is such an obvious ploy. My people will see right through it.""
If so, to you, I reply: ""Many of my coachees still send me messages like this. I know exactly what they are doing. Hell, I'm the one who showed them how to do it. And yet, I appreciate it every time. Because I know that they intend to create a connection with me and that always feels good.""
Another anecdote: The best operating CEO I've ever known, who self-admittedly doesn't have much emotional intelligence at all, once asked me: ""Matt, please help me to be more empathetic and create an emotional connection with my team."" So, I gave him the advice above. Being the best operator, he immediately and faithfully followed the advice. 
A month later, I facilitated a 2-day offsite for him and his executive team. When, at one point, he left the room, the entire executive team turned to me, and said ""How did you do it? He used to be a robot. And then about 30 days ago, he suddenly turned into this super-caring, super-compassionate guy."" And they started sharing with me examples of ways that he reached out to them in a very personal way. ""I was on the airplane with my family getting ready to go to my parents' house for Thanksgiving when I got a text from him saying: 'I hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke have a great time with your parents in Michigan. Safe travels.' I was blown away.""
Listening to all this was the newest executive hire, who had only just come on board. She was shocked. ""You mean he wasn't like this two months ago? I just went through the recruiting process with him and concluded that he is the most empathetic CEO I have ever known or even heard of.""

How to process discomfort by Sabrina Wang (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbvJAD06HDtpYzOyTgOGmtUOH02INTqMM3noq4UhxJo/edit ,"How to process discomfort (1 minute)
By Sabrina Wang, CEO Coach

The most important skill for entrepreneurship is processing discomfort. 

Your tolerance to discomfort is directly correlated to how much you'll think outside of the box. Or how quickly you can make hard decisions. The more you try, the more you fail, and the faster you grow.

My simple model of processing discomfort is Awareness -> Acknowledge -> Release -> Redirection.

Awareness
Many of us avoid discomfort unconsciously. So we first must understand what is uncomfortable for us individually, and how we respond.
Acknowledge
When we finally see how we are around discomfort, we can tend to judge or criticize ourselves immediately. We need to work to acknowledge the current state.
Release
Once we can acknowledge the discomfort and our initial response, we can work to release it. Releasing could be kinesthetic, emotional, and/or cognitive depending on the discomfort and the individual. 
Redirection
After release, we could redirect our focus based on our values and our priorities. What would I like to accomplish here? What is in the best interest of the company? 

There are different types of discomfort. Here are the most common ones I see in CEOs and how to get past them.

1. Anticipating others' emotional response
Most commonly, the CEO has hard feedback or hard decisions to make about a team member. This decision will most cause others to be fearful or angry. 
To get past it, role-play and ask your partner to act out the worst-case scenario.

2. Fear of making the wrong strategic decision
Sometimes, the best strategic move isn't obvious. 
To get past it, leverage your team. Use the Issue / Proposed Solution template and solicit comments from everyone who has context. Run a premortem to plan for worst-case scenarios.

3. Letting go, delegating, and trusting
Early-stage CEOs do lots of IC work. They will eventually need to level up and trust their teams.
To get past it, write down what needs to be true for you to trust your team. Make the ask.
Find the next high-leverage challenge that energizes you.","Entrepreneurship relies on processing discomfort for growth. Model: Awareness, Acknowledge, Release, Redirection. Types of discomfort and overcoming strategies shared."
How to spot fear and anger in others (by Sabrina Wang),https://mm-coaches.notion.site/How-to-spot-fear-and-anger-in-others-1a4cfdbee30a465f8545f4285826165b ,"# How to spot fear and anger in others

by [Sabrina Wang](https://sabrina-wang.super.site/) ([@sabrinawangzq)](https://twitter.com/sabrinawangzq)

[Fear and anger give bad advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit) is a core philosophy of the Mochary Method.

The best managers, whether a CEO or coach, are able to consistently identify fear and anger in others. It builds trust and creates valuable insights. 

People get the greatest insights when they can ...

1. Put fear and anger aside ([how to shift out of it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15oh13eYxxIyQoOx3_6RQCWzA6ETkxYOV_gtYMeTeBKE/edit))
2. Choose their thoughts and actions from a place of [possibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0PS8RwdbLGvSbmUCTX1y66Dy5xsInjqv1vad1EWCR0/edit?usp=sharing)

If you can spot fear and anger in others, this will result in efficiency and great decision-making from the people around you.

For example, once I called out a client’s fear that is telling him if he hires more, he’ll become a bad CEO who doesn’t do anything. As soon as he heard that, he pointed out that his fear doesn’t make any sense. He successfully shifted out of it and saw all the benefits in hiring. Then decided in 5 minutes he should move the hiring timeline even closer.

If you have a whole executive team who is willing to call you out on your fear and anger, you will course correct much quicker, sometimes multiple times a day.

So, how do you do that?

### Part 1:  **Framing (fear and anger experiment)**

The first thing to note is that you’ll feel uncomfortable pointing out fear and anger in others. We all have our own fears about being wrong, offending, or triggering someone.

My suggestion is to create a fear and anger experiment.

As the CEO, lead by example by being the one to propose this experiment. I recommend you start with your executive team. Share the “[Fear and anger give bad advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit)” write-up with the team. Make sure the principle resonates with each person on the team — if it does not, this experiment will not work. Come to a collective agreement that radical candor is crucial in the company because it leads to more efficient communication and clearer thought processes.

If everyone agrees, you can start this experiment for one week:

- The executive team will surface any perceived fear or anger in the CEO and their peers. They will use the phrase, **“I perceive you to be in anger.”** This is because it’s the hardest to spot and announce fear or anger in the co-founders, and easier to do with peers.
- Each person will be encouraged to do this at least once in public or private settings, as soon as the emotions occur.
- Encouraging the executive team to name the emotions is more important than getting it right. The purpose of this exercise is to build a foundation of trust and transparency. The pressure of getting it right will be counter-productive.

What do you do after someone tells you “**I perceive you to be in anger (or fear)”?**

- First, take a few deep breaths. Scan your body internally. Is there any sensation that is reminiscent of fear or anger? If yes, please say “Thank you” and remove yourself from the meeting until you are able to [shift out of fear or anger](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15oh13eYxxIyQoOx3_6RQCWzA6ETkxYOV_gtYMeTeBKE/edit).
- If you feel defensive, it’s likely that it’s a  “Yes”, and it’ll benefit everyone if you step out until you no longer feel defensive.
- If your internal scan does not reveal anything reminiscent of fear or anger, please say “Thank you.  I don’t sense anything internally.” You can then ask the others present in the meeting if they perceive the same. We are often the worst in perceiving those emotions in ourselves.

At the end of the week, ask each of the executive team members to write down their feedback and observations, along with whether they wish to continue doing so or not.

### Part 2:  **Spotting fear and anger**

Everyone shows fear and anger differently. Most of the time, it’ll show up more subtly than an outburst.

Here are some things to watch out for:

1. Silence
    
    If someone who’s usually excited to participate in certain topics goes quiet all of a sudden, it’s possible that they’re in fear or anger. Once one feels triggered by a conversation, their natural tendency can be to suppress and process it. When they do that, it takes mental and emotional energy, so they will not be able to verbally participate again. 
    
2. Speaking in a way that doesn’t reflect the person’s achievements
    
    When an executive team member asks you a question or makes a statement that doesn’t reflect their or their team’s achievements, they are most likely in fear. For example, your Head of Sales who’s been stellar asks, “What happens if we don’t hit our forecasts?”   It’s a cue to say, “I perceive you to be in fear.”
    
3. Interruptions
    
    Interruptions may be great bets to anger arising in a meeting. The interrupter may be frustrated to express themselves. The person who is interrupted may then get triggered and be in anger as well.
    
4. A speaking style that strays from baseline: faster, slower, higher, or lower
    
    Hopefully, you are used to your team’s usual way of speaking. If they suddenly start talking in a way that doesn’t resemble their baseline, they may be feeling fear or anger. For example, a fast talker starts speaking slowly, or someone who normally speaks with a low tone starts to speak at an even lower tone. 
    
5. Body language that strays from baseline: pursing lips, holding their chin, looking away, frowning, etc.
    
    In watching others’ body language, also pay attention to what strays from their normal posture or facial expression. 
    
6. Your own fear or anger arising
    
    Our bodies and emotions often react faster than our minds. If you’re observing an exchange, and you feel your own fear or anger arising... Chances are, one of the people engaging in the conversation is feeling fear or anger. So, it’ll be beneficial if you know your own signs of fear and anger. One way to do so is through consistent meditation practice, another way is through an [observation technique](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAoTba5Hig6Dm2DO3FjKy_KUibLupeXjKqijxYba5LM/edit) of watching emotions in your body. 
    

We all feel fear or anger daily. Without this practice of spotting it in others, coworkers process and identify emotions on their own. I believe this practice will make your team happier, closer, and more efficient.",Identifying fear and anger in others is crucial for efficient decision-making. The Mochary Method advocates for recognizing and addressing these emotions.
How to Train Salespeople by Sabrina Wang (4 mins),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjY9GDgPa9ACAMuiQ3IRfOQYyYNjsUVXVe4CqfiC6OY/edit,"How to Train Salespeople (4 mins)
By Sabrina Wang, CEO coach 


I am honored to serve some world-class coaches as their Head of Coaching at Mochary Method. During my tenure, I’ve learned that managing a coaching team is essentially like managing a sales team. This team has amazed me with their ability to deliver value during one of the hardest economies in tech. While coaching is about helping people grow and develop in their roles, I believe sales is about adding value and helping solve a problem. The principles of finding customers who would benefit apply in both cases.

 Training a sales team is an ongoing process. Here are the top strategies we learned together as a team:

Create documentation of the entire sales process
It’s important to have a first draft of the entire sales process to describe each touchpoint with the salesperson from the very first call to sending out the invoices. Create examples of everything from a call script to an email template. This way, everyone is on the same page and there is consistency in the sales process.

Shadowing and reverse-shadowing
The Sales to the Enterprise: how to scale it document describes the importance of shadowing and reverse-shadowing. I would recommend the shadowing period to be 2-4 weeks depending on the complexity of the product. Then another 2-4 weeks of reverse-shadowing. Ideally longer.
In reverse shadowing, give ample written and verbal feedback. More, ask the team permission to keep all feedback open. This way, other salespeople can access your feedback to one person. You can also encourage peer feedback to maximize the learnings of 1 recorded call. 
I give all feedback in this format:
1-5: I rate the call from 1-5. 3 being meeting expectations, 1 being it can’t be any worse, and 5 being it can’t be any better.
Like: what I liked about the call
Wish that: what I wish to see in the call to get this person to a higher rating

Create space during meetings for the team to raise their challenges and get support from the group
It’s important to us that the team feels like a cohesive unit, rather than individuals trying to compete with each other. There is so much wisdom and learning that happens when you learn to sell a new product or service. Much of that can be shared with the team outside of the individual silo. Here are the few ways that we’ve created space for the team to learn together:
Asked the team to write down their challenges with selling and crowdsource ideas and solutions
Asked the team to share how they’re feeling about their pipeline. Sometimes, the team doesn’t need more tactical tips. They just want to know everyone else is also feeling fear, disappointment, nervousness, and so on. This has been one of our most impactful tools.
Facilitated Q&A sessions with more seasoned salespeople to gain further insight
Ask new salespeople to teach each other a component of the sales process so they can master the subject, and evaluate if they truly understand the concept

Once the team has learned the documentation perfectly, they may still run into issues with selling. 
One of my teams made a great metaphor. The first stage of learning to sell a new product or service is like learning a new language. That stage is difficult. The second stage can be arguably harder - it’s when you use the new words to start making conversations. Here are the two main things that we leaned on to move through this stage:
Update documentation of the sales playbook to include new insights and learnings
Go through the entire process with team members 1-1. Find out where the salesperson feels the most discomfort and fear. Ask them to share their thoughts with you. Make them feel heard (Heard:  how to make people feel it) in those thoughts. Then, help them reframe and adapt those points in the process so that the entire process feels authentic to them. 
An example is that a salesperson may not be comfortable with holding the customer accountable for a decision during a call. Upon investigation, what they really feel bad about is appearing as pushy. What would be a way to get an answer from the customer without appearing to be pushy? Well, maybe they could ask the customer for direct feedback on the product or service. When you ask the customer for feedback, you’re also asking them to evaluate the experience to see if they want to work with you. 

If you’re a manager of a sales team, I would like to encourage you to think about this from the sales team’s perspective. Most people would be learning something new about the process, product, and service. Learning new things can be scary. So as a manager, it’s critical to provide as much clarity and feedback as possible that is customized to the individual’s natural communication style.","Sales team training involves creating sales process documentation, shadowing, feedback, group support, and adapting to individual communication styles for success."

That is the question.
When your company is doing well, many people will want you to take the company public: investors, employees, advisors, friends, family, etc. Publicly-traded shares create the most liquidity at (usually) the highest price for investors and employees alike. The company's lawyers, bankers, and accountants make tremendous fees at the IPO and subsequent transactions. Friends and family members take pride in your company being publicly traded. 
With all of these incentives in place, an IPO may feel like a foregone conclusion. It's not!
Publicly-traded shares do give a company financial flexibility. But they remove operational flexibility. A pernicious cascade of unintended consequences gets put in place upon an IPO that leads to a set of virtual shackles being placed on your (and your company's) ankles and wrists. 
Here's how it works:
The strength of your company's equity value allows you to retain great team members and acquire accretive companies. If your stock value drops significantly and for a sustained period, many of your best people will leave (as the value of their options will have dried up, and they can get hired elsewhere). Likewise, acquisitions will become too expensive to make. These dynamics will negatively and materially impact your ability to run the company well. Therefore, you will do whatever you can to ensure that the stock price does not drop significantly. And this is where the cascade begins.
Each quarter, you will have to forecast next quarter's performance and report on last quarter's actuals. There will be pressure to project growth each and every quarter. If not, shareholders will sell. Once projected, there will be even greater pressure to meet or exceed these projections. If not, shareholders will sell. The hamster wheel has begun to spin.
Now enter the short-sellers who believe that you will at some point fall off of this hamster wheel. They take a short position in your stock, and suddenly their incentive is to show the world all the worst things about your company so that the stock price drops now. Some of these short-sellers have integrity; some don't. Those who don't are willing to spread rumors, lies, and innuendo. While they may be dealing in fiction, the consequences for you are very real. 
And finally, there are the very real costs of satisfying the SEC's reporting requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley). This likely costs several million dollars a year in accounting and legal fees. But even more costly is the significant management overhead involved.
These days, the private markets offer tremendous capital (i.e., Softbank, sovereign wealth funds, Tiger Global, Coatue, GV, etc.) at strong valuations. Before creating public equity, reach out to public company CEOs and ask them what the cost/benefit really is.
Mark Zuckerberg famously wanted to keep Facebook private forever. But because many of his employees were exercising their options and selling on the secondary market to create liquidity, the company was at risk of exceeding 500 ""owners."" At this threshold, the SEC requires that a company have publicly-traded shares. In order not to run afoul of the law, Facebook went public.
Having seen this example, Palantir partnered with a secondary fund to offer liquidity to its employees so that they would never trip the 500+ owner barrier. 
Instead of giving in to all the voices around you (particularly from your institutional venture investors) that want you to go public, consider staying private. Capital is abundant in this world. Operational freedom, once lost, is tough to regain.

I don't want to minimize the positives of going public. They are there. It certainly makes fundraising easier if your company is performing well. From one such company's CEO:
""I will say, it is much easier to raise money as a public company. We recently raised $x billion in debt, and the entire process took one week, and I didn't have to do a single meeting. My CFO had to do a bunch of meetings, but totally different from private company raise that would derail my life for 1-2 months.""

If you do choose to go public, here are some bits of advice from the CEOs I coach who have already done so:
Don't do the roadshow in person. 
Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) has an even more radical idea: 
Don't do individual meetings. 
Instead, schedule 3 meetings. 
One with Fidelity, BlackRock, and one other major. 
Let all potential investors know the days and times to pick one that works for them. 
During each meeting, engage in a Q&A with the major investor. Once that major investor has completed their questions, open it up to a few others. 
I think there does need to be individual relationship-building. But that can happen after the general session gets all the basics of company information out of the way. Then the relationship-building meetings can focus on ... relationship-building.
Raise a smaller amount, then expand if needed, so you don't worry about it.
Let the CFO do all the blocking and tackling, i.e., select the service providers, prepare all the documents, the story, do the follow-up meetings, etc.

So, you have ignored my advice and chosen to go public. So be it. Well then, at least choose your investors wisely.
You are likely thinking: ""I can't choose my public equity investors. They choose me.""
Not if you tell the right story. 
Jeff Bezos was a public equity investor (worked at hedge fund DE Shaw), so he knew well which kind of investors he wanted and didn't. He knew that he wanted a stable stock price over time, and thus investors who would hold for the long-term and not bail when things looked bad (i.e., profits didn't materialize). But how to attract long-term holders? 
The answer: Scare away short-term investors. And the vehicle to do this is the IPO Founder Letter.
In his letter, Jeff famously encouraged investors to punish the company if it ever showed a large profit because that meant that it wasn't sufficiently investing in long-term growth. The vast majority of investors want to see significant profits, and they want to see them now. Only true believers (akin to religious zealots!) want the company to bury all its profits back into the company. And of course, when the company has no profits, there is no way for the public investor to really know if it's because the company is investing in the business, or the business just isn't that good and isn't producing much profit in the first place.
The ploy worked. Jeff attracted mostly true believers who allowed him to show almost no profits for ten years and still watch his stock price soar.
If you want to be treated that well, use your Founder Letter to scare away the faint of heart.  ","Founder letter advises IPO companies to attract long-term investors by scaring away short-term ones, like Jeff Bezos did successfully."

The day after you go public, I recommend that you send the following letter (or something like it) to the entire company:
Yesterday, we went public. At the end of the trading day, the market valued our company at ____.
And that is the last time I ever intend to talk about our valuation. Because talking about it, or even thinking about it, will never add any value to our business. But it may well take away from our business by inducing anxiety or distraction.
Mr. Market is a wild beast. And he will have wildly fluctuating views of our value. None of them are real. And each of them shall pass.
There will come a day when our stock price will suddenly tank. And on that day, I hope that each of us will ...
Look at our Mission, Vision, Values, OKRs ... and do the next highest priority action on our list.
There will also come a day when our stock price will suddenly soar. And on that day, I hope that each of us will ...
Look at our Mission, Vision, Values, OKRs ... and do the next highest priority action on our list.
In fact, my true hope is that none of us will even know if our stock price is soaring or tanking. I hereby commit to not looking at our stock price for the next three months to lead the way. I hope you will do the same. But even if you don't, please do not talk about it with me or anyone else in the company.
We capture our North Star in our Mission, Vision, Values, and OKRs. And nowhere in there have we written … ""think about our stock price.""","After going public, focus on the company's mission, vision, and values, not stock price fluctuations. Stay committed and focused."
Is CEO Coaching Worth It? (By Celine Teoh) (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJdSElD5yXaos4cjt48MDDgJMPSewldR9spLUUPBrZw/edit# ,"Is CEO Coaching Worth It?
Written by Celine Teoh, Alexis d’Amecourt, Sabrina Wang

Mochary Method is premium priced. One month with our coaches costs $10,000. Matt and Alexis charge $12,500. That’s a commitment.

No wonder prospective clients sometimes wonder if it’s worth it. And they question if they can sell it to their boards. Especially in these economic times.

Research shows that the ROI on typical executive coaching is anywhere from 6x to 9x. And with Mochary Method coaching, our clients see even greater returns, thanks to the outsized impact that coaching the C-suite has on the entire organization.

Steve Huffman: “When Sam Altman introduced me to Matt he said, ‘Matt will add a billion dollars of value to Reddit.’ I’ve been coaching with Matt now for 3 months, and I think that he already has.”

But the benefits of coaching go beyond just the financial returns. What is it worth to become the leader you want to be? What price would you put on transformation?

Investing in Mochary Method coaching is a commitment, but it is a commitment to the success of yourself and your organization. We believe the value generation and ROI will be well worth it, and we invite you to experience the transformative power of our coaching for yourself.




Mochary Method client case studies: 

Client with revenues of $50 million has big B2B contracts that are not closing
After one session with a Mochary coach, the CEO realizes the need to attend sales meetings to close crucial deals. Deals start closing. Successful meetings yield customer and process insights that are propagated across the sales team.
Result: Conversions go up by 5%. That’s $2.5 million annualized incremental revenue on $120k annual coaching cost. 
ROI: A whopping 21x! And, consider that this happened after one coaching session.


Client is having a tough time integrating engineering teams after an acquisition
After 1 session with a Mochary coach, they realize the unlock is redefining and clarifying roles & responsibilities, while putting boundaries in to protect the innovative culture of the acquired company. 
Result: A key product from the joint teams is delivered on time, underpinning the growth of the acquirer. 
ROI: Realization of the revenue and innovation culture synergies of the $multi-million transaction, hitting a key product milestone; estimate of double-digit ROI


Client has conflict with a key executive who’s underperforming
CEO is having a months-long conflict with an underperforming key executive/founding team member who is defensive when receiving feedback. The CEO feels like they can’t let this person go, so the leader is kept on for months even though key KPIs are falling behind and team morale and retention is dropping.

After a few sessions with a Mochary Method coach, the CEO finally decides to let this executive go with a generous package. The coach and the CEO rehearse and role-play the difficult conversation, which leads to the executive being calm and accepting when hearing the news. The CEO also works with the coach on a communication plan to the rest of the company that receives great feedback from employees.

Result: Leadership team alignment, and the CEO no longer has to closely manage an underperforming executive.

ROI: Revenue and cost-related KPIs are back on track. Retention from the leader’s team goes up, and the team does not have to spend more time and energy on hiring externally. Estimate of double-digit ROI!

Leadership team effectiveness
Client heads up multi-billion $ company where the executive team is not gelling
The team is experiencing conflict and challenges working together due to their remote-first arrangement, managing diversity, building strong relationships, and crafting a culture of safety. 

Their Mochary coach develops and runs a custom leadership offsite where the team comes together, clarifies stakeholder needs, works on decision-making frameworks, and builds trust across silos. The outcome is, in the words of the CEO, transformational.

ROI: Leadership team is more connected, has less conflict, and is ready to guide the company through IPO and beyond. Estimate of minimum of double digit ROI","Mochary Method CEO coaching is high-priced but offers significant ROI, transforming leaders, teams, and organizations for success and growth."

This template is used when a Report wants to share an Issue with a Manager in a 1-1.  If the Manager cannot help the Report resolve the Issue in the 1-1, but rather needs to share it with a wider group to resolve (ie- if this is a cross-department issue and a good decision requires the input and buy-in of other team members), then the content can easily be added to the group template.

Issue: 
Please state the problem.
What I did to help create this situation: 
Please make an honest effort to declare how you actually contributed to creating the situation. If you do, you will likely see a way to unwind the situation without relying on others to do so.
Proposed solution:
If you have done a good job of declaring how you helped create the situation, you can likely simply reverse those steps. Either way, please write out a solution with actions, a DRI: Directly-Responsible Individual for each, and a due date.
You may think, ""I don't know the answer. I'd rather list the options."" Please don't. Please write out what you would do if you had to decide, and you couldn't ask anyone for guidance. This declarative statement will be much easier for me to react to. 
Video/Audio:
Now that you have written the issue/proposed solution, please record a video (i.e., Loom) or audio of you describing each of the steps above and paste the video link here. 
Why? Because I need to hear the issue to understand it fully. The verbal presentation lets me know the emotions at play and the nuances you can't fully capture in writing. 
Why not just a video or audio, then? Because the writing creates the outline (i.e., clarifies your thinking), and is much easier for me to consume the fact-based content. In the end, to fully understand, I need to both read it and hear it.
Why not just present the issue in a live meeting? You can. But then I have to respond in real-time and cannot be as thoughtful in my response. It takes the same amount of time for you to record a video/audio as it does to present live, but you will get a higher-quality response if you share with me a video/audio in advance.

Issue: OKR Anxiety. In the drafting of team OKRs, people kept coming back to fear of not achieving them. Communication of these being stretch goals likely wasn't clear. They're afraid they won't hit their OKRs, even though we have communicated that the OKRs are aspirational. People may think that you will grade them negatively if they don't hit their OKRs.
Selected feedback from ""when you think of fear and when they think of our OKRs, what comes to mind?""
""Many OKRs are inter-dependent, so I worry about systemic failure, e.g., SeqMatic also having trouble generating good RNA-seq data or having difficulty finding a suitable PD model in time for screening.""
""Fear that we base OKRs on experiments yielding hits and positive data, but there is no guarantee that the experiments will be successful. We can only realistically project that the experiments will be performed, which endpoints will be measured, and how many compounds can be screened in a given time frame.""
Solution:
Re-iterate to the team that OKRs are aspirational, and performance feedback will be given at 1:1s.
All managers will give a 0-10 grade during their 1:1s each week. Eight and above means you are performing well at the company and don't need to worry. Below eight means you are not hitting minimum/floor goals and need improvement. This way, people will know that they are achieving above the performance expectations even if there is uncertainty about the achievement of the actual OKR.
Decision
All managers gave one rating during 1:1 - you're doing well or needs improvement

Issue: Lab Move. The team feels stressed about achieving their OKRs given the pending lab move. Stressed out by company team-building events, they want to work. Lab move will interrupt a lot of their work. Feedback that we're underestimating the potential delays of the lab move. Uncertainty around the lab move. I don't want to burn people out. 
Solution:
Ben is now the owner of the lab move and will give weekly updates at the experimental meeting on the status of the lab move and answer any questions, write down issues, and present solutions in the following week. 
Present GANT chart timeline of when experiments will start/stop as part of the weekly update
Best case vs. mid-case vs. worst-case timelines will also be presented. 
Ben to put together the current state by next Thursday and where the most significant uncertainties.
Ideal outcome: Move-in equipment before we can move in people. Now it is all happening at once. Dates keep getting pushed back. 
More about expectations. When are we going to get experiments started again? 

Issue: Too many hires at once is causing lots of calendar cadence violations. Candidates have the best opportunity to meet all Company X employees on Thursdays, but candidates on site for Thursday forces calendar cadence violation. Jennifer needs to cancel all or most 1:1s on Thursdays to accommodate candidate interviews for every candidate. 
We've received feedback that the experimental team wants to meet every candidate. We've also received feedback that meetings are disruptive to the team. To adhere to calendar cadence, we need to choose one day for all candidate interviews. So, the team will have to choose (until January) between:
Candidate meeting days happen on the same day as the internal experimental meeting day (Thursday): the whole team can meet candidates, but 1:1s will be canceled every time a candidate visits, and scientists may have multiple internal meetings.
Candidate meeting days happen on separate days as internal meeting days: Scientists will only have one day of internal meetings, but the whole team won't meet every candidate unless they are interviewing them or attending dinner.
Proposed solution: We should prioritize scientists having uninterrupted days of bench time. As we grow, it will become impossible anyways to have everyone always meet every candidate. There is also significant overhead in re-scheduling meetings. Best to keep one consistent internal meeting day and one day where everyone knows there will be potential interviews for consistency - easier to plan experiments without changing dates. So change a different date for candidate interviews, not Thursday. Propose Tuesdays for candidates onsite. Team members who want to meet candidates can sign up in advance to participate in the interview process. This will keep calendar cadence. 
Steve: Tuesday
Fernando: Friday
Raj: Friday seems good. Wednesday and Thursday appear already too booked.
Fred: Not Thursday or Wednesday to violate calendar cadence, depending on the team/position. Is it necessary that the whole team meets every candidate for every position? The company is getting big now. Indeed, we want the people they will directly be working with to meet them & give feedback.
Alina: Friday, easier for candidate dinners for the team and allows people from MMRI/Mission bay to meet the candidate on their way back home if they are in the city
George: Upcoming computational job candidates are already scheduled for Thursdays. I vote for Thursdays (for computational job candidates) and Wednesdays for experimental candidates.
Tony: Monday or Friday or any day of the week to accommodate candidates who are employed. Only bring in candidates; we're 75% sure we want to extend an offer to cut down on visits. Ask the candidate to travel to multiple sites on the same day to accommodate Company X staff.
Erik: M-F is ok for me. It is not possible/necessary for every team member to meet every candidate. Any day of the week can work for me, but mornings > afternoons. Also, perhaps we need to screen candidates better to meet the ~75% threshold for offers.
Katherine: Tuesday. I agree that not every person needs to meet every candidate. 
Luke: Tuesday
Katherine: Friday. But please let's keep Monday and Tuesday completely free of meetings. 
Decision:
Candidate interview days on Friday for Experimental Team 
Susan will check with Matt about if OK to have two different days 
Report at next LT meeting 

Issue: Employees are sick and coming into the office, possibly making other team members sick. 
Solution: Emphasize a company policy that if you're sick, please work from home.
Company policy that all employees must stay home until 24 hours after they have been fever-free. Buy a thermometer.
If you have a fever, ask someone to cover for you 
Let the manager know if sick
VHS to send a message on Slack with the above policy - DONE

Issue: Lack of Clear Agreements Overall sense in most experimental projects, someone from the computational team will nebulously complete downstream analysis, but this is never accounted for explicitly in the project plan. Frequently, there is not an explicit agreement on when data needs to be delivered until too late. Then, lots of stress around ""hair on fire"" problems. We need a system for forming and tracking more straightforward agreements in advance. Too many owners on each project right now - we need one owner. 
Proposed solution: Require project proposals include explicit timelines that include the time required for all analyses, including computational analyses. All stakeholders in the project should agree and sign off on the project before the project launches. This would allow all the stakeholders to schedule their time upfront.
Use Labguru to schedule all analysis activities as part of the study. Includes wet lab and dry lab activities.
Whoever initiates the project is responsible for following through with the end deliverable on time and soliciting feedback and agreement on dates for each aspect of the project and analysis. 
Decision: accept the proposed solution.

Issue: Not Keeping Agreements. People are not keeping their agreements and timelines. People say yes to everything, even action items that are too ambitious, miss timelines. The consequence is that experiments are delayed or executed with incomplete analysis. I feel that people agree to items they don't have full body approval. Yet, there are few/little repercussions if agreements or deadlines aren't met regarding data analysis and deliverables. How do we avoid unanticipated hair-on-fire problems and distractions in the future?
Solution:
Start tracking completion rates of action items each person sets during accountability sections of 1:1s
These are weekly action items set by each person for themselves that are necessary to complete their goals
Make clear that the target is 100%
If continue to achieve < 100% completion of accountability during 1:1s, the manager lets them know needs improvement

Issue: 
Like the RAPID process and how it involves invested parties and solicits input from experts, at least for this round, started late and are halfway through the quarter, without completing team or individual OKRs. 
Proposed Solution: Moving forward should start sooner, so don't eat into the quarter before finalizing.
Action: Leadership team is working on scheduling planning for Q1 2019 OKRs before Christmas. - Done; meetings tentatively scheduled for the week of Dec. 17th.

Issue: 
Data management is driving me nuts. Currently, I'm trying to update the board deck and realizing I'm spending lots of time finding data. Not everything is updated on Google drive or Labguru, and I'm hopping around many places. Even the ""ALS data to date"" google slides aren't current with new data. Spend a lot of time digging in Slack for updated data and going to multiple places to find the data. 
Proposed solution: Set a date for labguru training. Start uploading all current studies on labguru. No more google doc or folders for lab data. Eventually integrate with web portal. Also include dates for studies and specific activities (i.e., cells plated, dosed, data ready for analysis, etc.). 
Discussion: Concern that some big data can't live in labguru. What about raw images?
Decision: Start putting as much data into labguru, and develop a separate policy for exceptions.
Raj, when he sees outdated slides, will let the presenter know. 
Fernando to send a calendar invite for LabGuru training.

Issue: 
People at the Bench need an unbroken time to suit up and do experiments from start to finish. Meetings sprinkled throughout the day causes significant disruption.


Proposed solution:
Calendar Cadence. For all non-managers at the company, incorporate two days of meetings and three days of NO meeting time. Circulate this as a company policy. Even on meeting days, there still needs to be lab time.

Issue:
Create a system for decisions and buy-in. Document and circulate the outcome of the decision.


Proposed Solution:
Team to read Decision-making
Issue/Proposed Solution, if no consensus, then 
RAPID

Issue:
Wish that there was more context around this whole exercise. Everything was a brief introduction. What is the premise, goal?


Proposed Solution:
Matt to give full intro and context at All Hands


Issue: 
Susan's time management. A lot of our 1-1s got changed at the last meeting. Happens more often than not. When these changes occur, it forces me to rejigger my entire schedule—during the Series A, meeting with different firms. There wasn't enough prep time to gather the info—a lot of fire drills.


Proposed Solution:
Calendar Cadence.
Susan to hold meeting agreements.


Issue: 
We have aggressive timelines. Ambition is great. Sometimes, we don't have a sense of realism, both in workload, resources, time, etc. Many variables are out of our control or we don't even know about. Things go wrong much more often than can be predicted.
However, from the company's perspective, achieving more significant milestones (such as a development candidate by our Series B) is critical to our survival. The question is, how can we create a system that allows for things to go wrong but allows us to stay on track for our larger milestones?


Proposed solution:
In plan, incorporate a 10% buffer for unexpected issues to come up in the lab. [ideas for how to include this buffer, practically speaking?] 
The long-term timeline to get to Series B must stay.
However, the path to get there can have a buffer as long as it is still on target.
Rank-order all OKRs. Focus on the top OKRs. Tighter timelines on the higher priorities. Require feedback on 4Q OKRs
Decision:
Team to read Decision-making for buy-in.
Create more buy-in for the OKRs by: 
Getting feedback from every single scientist first.
Susan, Jennifer, and George to share clearly 
Why each OKR is clearly needed for the company to succeed in its mission
OKRs are aspirational and will not be used for performance measurement
Weekly feedback (Like-Wish That) feedback will be given to each team member 
If each Team Member acts on the Wish That feedback, that will be the basis for positive performance measurement. 
Therefore, floor OKRs are not needed right now.

",Team faces OKR anxiety due to unclear communication. Lab move stress addressed by assigning responsibility. Calendar violations resolved by scheduling.
Job Responsibilities Rubric by Faith Meyer (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dMxcNgm3pQe_dR9_UjwucbxtSG1k7Wj8RFdQag5FQ-U/edit?usp=sharing ,"Job Responsibilities Rubric by Faith Meyer (4 min)

Video — Faith Explains the Rubric (2.5 min @ 1.5x)

TL;DR Don’t wait for formal review rounds to have crucial conversations with your direct reports. Create a shared agreement that clearly spells out the core components of their role (how specifically you’re measuring their performance) and regularly reference it in your 1:1s — monthly at an absolute minimum.



The Job Responsibilities Rubric is the single most effective tool I have used over the years — as CEO, COO, and managing hundreds of direct reports. It takes a little time to create (~30 minutes) but once the rubric exists, it’s extremely easy to update and will evolve over time. Here’s why it’s so effective:

Waiting until formal Performance Reviews to have these detailed performance conversations is the single greatest failing of management that I see.

Most employees experience constant anxiety and/or uncertainty when they aren't sure where they stand. Giving absolute feedback regularly (no less than monthly in a 1-1) will eliminate this anxiety. 

Having difficult conversations and setting clear goals with your direct reports also builds trust and improves performance; avoiding problems only creates headaches and bigger issues in the long run.

1-1 Template with Performance Rubric Included
Job Responsibilities Rubric Templates

WHAT IT IS
A powerful management tool for high-performing cultures that:
Clearly spells out expectations/what success looks like for your direct reports in their roles
Supports effective 1-1s via transparency, accountability and clear/direct communication 
Gives your direct reports clear reporting topics so you always get updates on the key performance areas and indicators
Lays the groundwork for positive engagement and seamless performance reviews
Documents performance results to support clearer decision making for promotions, comp, PIPs, coaching people out or into different roles, and letting people go
Is the result of years of experimenting on learnings and building on, the primary influences being The Management Center and Radical Candor

THE GOAL 
Use this rubric monthly at a minimum in your 1:1 (one-on-one) meetings with your direct reports.
Very clearly outline each component of your direct report’s job responsibilities and performance assessment criteria — ideally from Day One. (Clear expectations build trust and motivation!)
To give a qualitative, absolute feedback scale that you and your direct report can use to measure how they’re performing in each area. You’ll further build trust and motivation through collaboration, praise and clear/constructive feedback! Plus, like with magic questions, you can set a goal of having the employee be at a 4 or higher in all categories.

Let your direct report know you’re experimenting with a new tool to help you better support them in their role, and ask if they would be willing to create a first draft.
Ask them to spell out the core elements of their role prior to your next 1:1. (If they’re not sure, ask them, “How are you measuring your own success in your role?”)
In your 1:1, review together, make any needed refinements, and commit to using it regularly in your 1:1s going forward (once per month at the absolute minimum).
You Create the Rubric
Look at the job posting you used to hire your direct report. Consider including your org’s core values. 
Spell out the core responsibilities, performance criteria and any other key skills/ abilities/additional responsibilities they’ve been given or have taken on.
Let your direct report know you’re experimenting with a new tool to help you better support them in their role, and ask for their input.
Ask them what’s missing and what (if anything) needs to be adjusted to feel all-encompassing for the core elements of their role.
Agree/disagree + commit based on their input, and then begin regularly using the rubric going forward.

GENERATING BUY-IN
New Hires: Let your new hire know that you will both complete this rubric prior to your check-ins and formal reviews, and that it will evolve alongside them and their role.
Current Employees: When you first introduce this rubric later in someone’s employment, it’s critical to communicate that it is NOT in any way a punishment.
You can say something like, “I want to do more to support your success here. This will help us be sure we’re on the same page and get ahead of any challenges/problems that may arise as you grow and take on more.”  
This rubric can provide effective support for PIPs as well. 


USING THE RUBRIC
Use bi-weekly during 1:1s so the structure becomes second nature. Do not wait for formal reviews.
If that’s too frequent (i.e. the ratings aren’t changing), review monthly at a minimum.
*Remember: Consistency and clear communication build trust and get results!*
If you’re not a fan of the grid, use a plain text version in your 1:1 doc or whatever shared agreements tracker you use with your direct report.
You and your DR should each fill out your ratings prior to each performance check-in. 
Review the rubrics side by side with your DR during your 1:1s, and pay special attention to where the ratings are not aligned. For example:


These discrepancies are great opportunities for you [both!] to seek to understand why the ratings were given. 
This often shines a light on where you two are not on the same page
Hearing their reasoning can be a great jumping off point for you to be a great manager — i.e. to reinforce, more clearly define expectations/goals, provide accountability, support, etc.
Use insights to consistently praise your direct report’s successes, address concerns, and give constructive feedback.
During the 1:1s, consider asking your direct report to include qualitative takeaways in addition to the number rating. 
E.g. What’s one thing that went well for you here? What’s something that felt like a struggle? Where did you get stuck?
Always ask them to wrap up by repeating back what actions/next steps they intend to take between now and your next meeting. In your next session, start by checking in on those actions.
Incorporate Mochary Method 1:1 pre-work for even greater results!


20-SECOND RECAP
Clearly define each core element and skill that you will focus on to measure your direct report’s performance. Lay each item out in a rubric that you and your DR complete prior to each 1:1 meeting. Compare the evaluation during your 1:1s, paying special attention to discrepancies in your ratings. Use these observations to explicitly spell out what success looks like to support your DR’s growth and wins. 

Further Context:
SUCCESS STORY
As a leader and manager, I personally struggled with finding the most effective way to A) reinforce explicitly stated expectations for performance and workplace behavior, B) get consistent reporting in place for my executive team, and C) to nurture a culture of high performance, radical candor and 360° support. 
This job responsibilities rubric was the first practical tool that our Director of Customer Experience and I felt made it the easiest for us to give constructive feedback AND for our direct reports to receive that feedback. 
Why? For me, being able to lay our completed rubrics down side by side and look for the areas where our ratings didn’t line up not only created a tangible sense of collaboration and alignment, it also gave me clear opportunities where I could level set and/or reinforce a DR’s strong performance (where they were grading themselves too harshly), as well as clear opportunities to explicitly communicate expectations and what success looked like to me (when they were grading themselves too generously).
Lo and behold, when our DCE rolled this rubric out to her team, that created a tangible forward momentum for our company as a whole, and our collective performance (and therefore our results) all leveled up as we further embraced radical candor, accountability and 360° support. ","Creating a Job Responsibilities Rubric is crucial for effective management, providing clear expectations and fostering regular feedback to support growth."
Key Leadership Competencies by Faith Meyer (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiDXcdKUyT3AKA0L5MLi-oXUk4B27gASxBwqXVTYbUw/edit?usp=sharing ,"Key Leadership Competencies by Faith Meyer (2 min)

Leadership is many things: the capacity to get things done with and through your team, an art, a constant unfolding of learning, responding and adapting, especially as your business evolves and matures over time. 

That said, every leader has their blind spots and growth edges — within their organizations, and in their lives — and yet it can be challenging to put your finger on those precise needs. 

Here’s how to find where you can improve:

Emergent Competencies
Yes, there are principles that we can all agree upon (see below) as core leadership competencies, but as a coach, I believe it’s far more impactful to focus first on what your team and your company need from you. 

In your 1:1s, ask your direct reports (and anyone else you’d like to involve in this information gathering process — e.g. mentors, board members, other team members) the following questions:

What do they need from you?
What do they want more of from you?
What’s not helpful for them?
What do they appreciate the most about how you lead?

Set 30 minutes of uninterrupted time aside for yourself when your mind is fresh and sit with the following questions:

What are you most proud of in how you lead?
What would you like to do more of to be even more effective as a leader?
Where do you feel like you’re hitting a limit/plateau?
Where do you wish you could do better/be a more effective leader?
Where and when are you getting stuck?
Tune into when you feel dissatisfaction, frustration, anger and confusion throughout your work days. These emotions can be extremely helpful in shining a light on growth edges and upper limits.

For each of the items you come up with, clearly spell out why it’s important to you. Without that “why” you can lose focus and momentum, especially when the work to improve is uncomfortable.

Skim Over Our Curriculum


What areas jump out at you as growth edges? 
Consider sharing the curriculum with your executive team. What areas jump out at them as growth edges?

Core Leadership Competencies
Anywhere you look, you can find list after list of different frameworks and critical competencies leaders “must” have. I prefer guidance from orgs like McKinsey that provide insights based on emergent data. Consider these “4 of 20 behaviors [that] explain 89 percent of the variance between strong and weak leaders” per McKinsey & Co.:


Supporting Others
As CEO, the best thing you can do to support your team is to drive clarity (e.g. be crystal clear on the “what” so they can deliver the “how”) and unblock your team. When you do this, and your team feels your genuine care for them, you “build trust and inspire and help colleagues to overcome challenges.”
Solving Problems Effectively
This is nuanced and tricky to nail, but leaders and leadership teams make good decisions when this is done well. A big blocker here for most leaders is how to support through accountability.
Operating with a Strong Results Orientation
“Leaders with this trait emphasize the importance of efficiency and productivity and prioritize the highest-value work.” This is directly connected to the mission critical importance of setting goals/KPIs/OKRs for your team so that they know what to prioritize.
Seeking Different Perspectives
We know how dangerous echo chambers and biases can be. Leaders who embody this trait “typically base their decisions on sound analysis and avoid the many biases to which decisions are prone.”

Here’s the larger list of 20 behaviors from McKinsey’s article Decoding Leadership: What Really Matters.


Next Steps
With this clarity in mind, remember that consistency is key to meaningful behavioral change. You’ve had your whole life to get great at whatever behavior you want to change, so give yourself grace and time to stick the landing on how you’re trying to change.

Also remember to not try to “boil the ocean” by tackling everything all at once. Discern what is truly most urgent and mission critical for you and your org, and prioritize those top items. Talk it through with your coach, and they’ll help you be as efficient and effective as possible when tackling each growth edge while shortening the learning curve.","Leadership involves learning, adapting, and seeking feedback. Focus on team needs, self-reflection, and core competencies like support, problem-solving, results, and perspective."
Leadership vs Team Leads Meeting (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAdsheOc1RAS1-FC1PMImJ_sRGfug-SPamvTpu5P5vs/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Leadership vs Team Leads Meeting (3 min)
As the company grows, each Team will become a large entity (i.e., Biz Ops, Design, Communications, Compliance, etc.). An individual product may grow large enough to warrant being its own business unit with its own GM. Thus there will be many VP-level execs. You will want to keep them informed and empowered. There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not.
If someone needs to attend a meeting to be informed about what occurs or to have their voice fully represented, in that meeting, you have not yet created a transparent system. 
Each meeting should have clear notes of all updates and decisions made (other than those around compensation and individual performance improvement). You should freely publish those notes to the company. So, everyone can know what happened in a meeting without actually attending. In addition, each employee should be encouraged, weekly, to write up any Issues they see in the company, their department, etc., and write up their Proposed Solution as well. These written Issues/Proposed Solutions are then elevated to the right decision-making meeting with the employee represented in her own written words.
The meeting then becomes a way of making good and fast decisions. 
Your Brain Trust should attend the Leadership Meeting. Who are the essential minds that you need to hear from to make great decisions? And which people run the major business units that you need to make sure are continually unblocked? These should be the attendees of the Leadership Team meeting. Do not add any other attendees to assuage their ego. They will make the meeting less efficient.
(It is quite common for General Counsel and Chief People Officer to make Leadership Meetings inefficient. They often want to bring up endless non-strategic Issues/Proposed Solutions on legal and people-related issues. They often have a knee-jerk ""no"" response to many strategic decisions. They are risk managers. This is their training. 
If this is happening in your meeting, be very clear with them about what is and isn't additive behavior, and continue to give the feedback until they are as additive as all others. If you cannot do that, then do not invite them to the Brain Trust meeting.)
For all the rest of your Department and Team Leads, there is a VPs (or Team Leads) Meeting. At this meeting, announce the decisions that were just made in the Leadership Meeting. There is then a ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment. If any of these decisions will have unintended negative consequences, now is the time for the VPs to raise their hand and say, ""That is a terrible idea for these reasons …"". The decision then gets kicked into a RAPID. But for the vast majority of decisions, the VPs will be fine with it, and then the decision gets published to the company, likely in All Hands.
To understand the scale of these meetings, I posit that the Leadership Team should be, and remain at, 6-8 people. This level is where verbal discussion is most effective. Think of a dinner party. The rule is no more than eight… for a reason. (You can stretch to ten, but meetings will become drawn out.)
The VPs Meeting, by contrast, should grow as the company scales. At a company of 1,000 employees, the VPs Meeting often has 15-20 attendees. At Microsoft, this same meeting has over 150 attendees.
To give the VPs more visibility into how decisions are being made, Amazon now holds its Exec Team meetings in an auditorium. The VPs sit in stadium-seating, silently observing. 
You can recreate this information flow by inviting observers to your exec meeting. There are two keys to this:
Make explicit the status of each participant (Participant vs. Observer) and strictly enforce those roles.
Only add Observers if you have a culture of radical candor where the Exec Team will continue to say EXACTLY what they would have without the Observers present.","Leadership Team meetings are exclusive, with clear notes published for transparency. VPs and essential minds attend, while Team Leads have separate meetings."
Legal - closing a round - cost and time (4 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fkxV3WpUMhdlx_K7kFoyqQ96C1VY5YYp6-Wd1y10oWU/edit#heading=h.m3y5s2r0wzfn ,"Legal - closing a round - cost and time (4 min)
You will need a named-brand law firm to manage your priced rounds. They will only be too eager to help; this is one of their favorite ways to bill large amounts. But there is a technique to manage costs and time. If you let them bill however they want, the result could easily be over $100,000 for a Series A investment. However, if you manage them aggressively, you can get that bill down to $20,000 or less. This is important because the company is often required to pay for both their own counsel and that of the investor if the investor's bill exceeds a certain amount (usually $25,000).
A typical investment happens like this:
Lawyers call each other to discuss the terms. They disagree on a point.
Company lawyer calls Company Decision-maker for guidance. (For every email written or voicemail left, the lawyer charges for 15 minutes minimum, but usually 1 hour.)
Company Decision-maker responds to Company lawyer. (Another billable hour.)
Company lawyer reaches out to Investor lawyer. (Another billable 1-2 hours.
The investor lawyer then reaches out to the Investor Decision-Maker on this same issue. (Another billable 1-2 hours.)
Investor lawyer responds to Decision-maker lawyer. (Another billable 1-2 hours.)
This exchange continues back and forth, racking up billable hours until they agree to every detail. The process takes 45-60 days to get final documents, and the legal bill is often over $100,000 from each side.
But there is another way. It results in final documents in less than one- week and legal bills of less than $20,000 from each side.
Investors must pay for legal bills out of their management fee income. This income would otherwise go into their pockets, so investors do not like to pay for legal fees (even their own). They would prefer to give the company more money (which comes out of the fund's investment capital) than pay for the investor's lawyers. Make this accommodation for investors. Require only that the investor support you in enforcing rules of behavior on their lawyers. And those rules are:
Once the basic terms of investment are agreed upon (in a Term Sheet), schedule a 4- to 8- hour meeting (or call). (This meeting may only last 2-3 hours, but enough time must be blocked off to allow it to run longer if necessary.) Required attendees are: 
Decision-maker from the Company
Decision-maker from the Lead Investor
Lawyer for the Company
Lawyer for the Lead Investor


If any of the four people cannot make the meeting (or call), then reschedule the meeting.


The lawyer, for one side, prepares the first draft of the investment documents. The lawyer for the other side responds with written comments before the meeting/call. There is no other contact between the lawyers.


At the meeting, everyone reviews the documents from beginning to end, paragraph by paragraph, and addresses all written comments. Lawyers are not allowed to speak except to advise their clients on the meaning of the paragraph being reviewed. The negotiation is between Decision-makers at the Company (CEO) and the Lead Investor (investor) directly. The Decision-Makers go through every point until they have reached an agreement on all of them. As each point is agreed upon, the lawyers then agree upon the wording that best reflects the business agreement that was just made in real-time.


The lawyer who wrote the base document then writes up the final language. The other lawyer confirms that this language is precisely what they had agreed upon during the call. The documents are then final.
In this process, the Lawyer for the company can bill no more than:
4 hours Write up base documents
1 hour Read comments prior to the big meeting
8 hours Attend the big meeting
4 hours Write up final language
17 hours @ $1,000 per hour = $17,000
In this process, the Lawyer for the investor can bill no more than:
4 hours Write comments on the base documents
8 hours Attend the big meeting
2 hours Read the final language
14 hours @ $1,000 per hour = $14,000","Closing a round of investment legally can cost over $100,000. Effective management can reduce this to under $20,000."
Legal (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhgD5qLVYHDNSszHTL1tX_uhGMgfAWjFnikHwGsqaxI/edit# ,"Legal (2 min)
There are several actions within a company that require the help of a lawyer: negotiating and documenting investments (whether SAFE or preferred equity), establishing hiring and firing procedures (to comply with HR law), negotiating and signing customer contracts (Non-Disclosure Agreements and commercial contracts), obtaining visas for foreign team members, etc.
Many large multi-discipline law firms are very familiar to investors (Wilson; Cooley; Orrick; Fenwick; Goodwin Procter; etc.) and with whom investors feel comfortable. Therefore, it is good to use such a law firm to document the preferred equity documents. The additional cost for this law firm is more than paid for by the benefit of making the investor feel comfortable.
However, that is where the utility of using the big law firm ends. While the big law firm has the resources to do every kind of legal work the company has, the amount that they will charge for this work is (in my experience) about 10x what could be achieved by working with specialty boutiques and solo practitioners. And the specialists usually do better work.
So, the key is to find a solo practitioner to be your outsourced General Counsel early on in the company's life cycle. 
If your company is in person, I prefer to find a lawyer who lives and works close to the company and then require that they come into the office to do their work (and only bill for their time physically at the company). If there is a need to do work outside of the company, I recommend that you only pay for it if the lawyer has gotten specific written permission (email) in advance for both the work and the hours to be billed. 
If your company is remote, simply substitute ""co-work on a Zoom call"" for ""come into the office."" 
If you don't follow this strict procedure, the lawyer can bill for whatever hours they claim the work took. You will have no way of successfully disputing their claim. And you will be on the hook for the bill, even if it is outrageous (which it almost certainly will be).
Solo practitioners are happy to follow these guidelines. Large law firms never agree to them. And because lawyers from large law firms do not come onsite, the amount of time they spend on an issue (or at least claim that they spend on an issue) goes up by 5x over someone who is onsite. Add on top of that that large law firm billing rates are about 2x those for solo practitioners, and you get a bill that is 10x larger and a work product that is often inferior.
Once you have an outsourced General Counsel who comes to your office to do all of your legal work, they can find and manage that specialist for you if a different specialty is needed (immigration, employment, etc.).","Using a big law firm for investments is beneficial, but for other legal needs, solo practitioners are more cost-effective and efficient."
Liquidity (4 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDXPJtrqbMuFsPfW_ixEWqvPf20FHAa8D9xZPyPXnVY/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Liquidity (4 min)
If your company truly succeeds, you will likely find yourself equity rich but still cash poor. It is essential to create liquidity and diversify out of your company's stock. The general rule of thumb is to have no more than 25% of your net worth in ""alternative assets"" (illiquid assets). Because your company's equity is likely the majority of your net worth, your net worth is likely >95% alternative assets. It will be close to impossible to sell 75% of your stake in your company. Instead, know that two absolute numbers are significant. $10 million and $100 million.
Most people at $10 million of liquid net worth have the feeling of safety. They breathe a sigh of relief. They are no longer at risk. However, once they sit with that number for a while (and start to raise a family), their mind begins to play through disaster scenarios of how that net worth could disappear altogether. Once their liquid net worth grows past $100 million, the catastrophe scenarios dry up, and a sense of abundance follows. This level is what you are driving for. 
The reality is that $10 million is more than enough to live an extraordinary life. But give the mind what it wants. After $100 million, each additional dollar will likely not add in any way to your life and may well create a burden (if you buy assets that need to be maintained and supervised).
Therefore, as soon as your company's equity begins to have significant value, start to sell to secondary share buyers until you have sold $10-100 million. 
Note: Some investors believe that fear is the best motivator. Therefore, they do not want you to get any (or at least not meaningful) liquidity until they maximize the company's value. I believe that joy is a much better motivator than fear, and therefore I take the opposite view on founder liquidity.
Bank versus Brokerage
The next question becomes: Where do I put the $10-100 million?
You have three choices:
Commercial Bank (i.e., Citibank)
Investment Bank (i.e., Goldman Sachs)
Brokerage (i.e., Schwab)
Holding your money in a commercial bank is a terrible idea. Commercial banks will hold your money and then lend it out to others. The bank gets all of the upsides of these loans, and you bear all of the risks. If the economy tanks and the loans go bad en masse, then the bank fails, and (barring a federal intervention) all of your assets go to pay off the creditors of the bank itself.
Investment banks are similar to commercial banks in that they will use your money to generate profits for their own account. The only difference is that investment banks are not restricted to loans. They can make any kind of bet or investment with your assets. The bank receives all of the upsides while you bear all of the risks. Again, it is a terrible idea to hold your money at an investment bank.
Finally, there are brokerage firms (i.e., Schwab, Fidelity). These firms do not make loans or investments on their own account. Whatever assets you place at a brokerage firm remain in your name, are only invested in the way you direct, and remain the sole beneficiary. That being said, a brokerage firm is still a business and can go bankrupt if its expenses exceed its revenues for an extended time (though this is much less likely than at a bank that is almost sure to go bankrupt in a sharp economic downturn). In that case, your assets do get tied up in bankruptcy court, with one exception: US Treasuries. US Treasuries are never held in custody. They are always held for the beneficial owner. If the brokerage firm were to go bankrupt, your US Treasury certificates would be sent directly to you and not held by the bankruptcy court.
So, start by placing your liquid assets in a brokerage firm. Then invest all of the cash into US Treasuries while you decide on your investment strategy.
Investing
Now that the money is in a safe place, how do I invest it?
David Swensen is the Chief Investment Officer for the Yale University Endowment. He is considered the grandfather of portfolio management. He wrote a book specifically for the individual investor entitled Unconventional Success. I believe it is the bible for individual asset management. In it, he convincingly describes how professional money managers who can create alpha are exceedingly rare, and you likely will never meet them. The money managers you encounter will probably never create positive net returns (after they siphon off their fees and carried interest) compared to the public equity markets. Therefore, the best approach is for you to simply invest in low-cost index funds (i.e., Vanguard) according to a specific allocation (he recommends about 35% US Equities, 35% non-US Equities, 5% Real Estate and 25% US Treasuries) and then re-balance as often as possible. 
Unfortunately, re-balancing means putting in lots of trades, and that is painful. Luckily, someone built a tool to solve that problem. Wealthfront is the leading auto-rebalancing investment engine. Many others have copied it, but as of 2018, it is still my preferred vehicle. I keep the majority of my liquid equity net worth there. 
The only glaring flaw of Wealthfront is that it doesn't yet allow an investor to set a % to hold in US Treasuries. So, those I have at Schwab.
There is a new version of Wealthfront called With Compound that is both low-cost and solves the problem of custom % allocations.  Its target customer is the tech founder, with high paper worth and low liquidity.","Create liquidity by selling company equity, aim for $10-100 million net worth. Deposit funds in brokerage, invest in low-cost index funds."
Liquidity Programs for the Company (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6S84UmEuggKiXVwjb00Qz633gda-6skwOS2T7iFvas/edit ,"Liquidity Programs for the Company (3 min)
 
Late-stage private companies are increasingly doing secondary liquidity programs to attract and retain employees and relieve pressure to go public prematurely.
Here are your levers as the CEO:
1) You decide when to do the program. 
Companies typically do these programs shortly following a primary round when a new preferred price has been set. That timing is advantageous because sellers can be more confident in the price they're being offered for their common shares.
2) You set the eligibility rules for participation.
Is the program only open to employees and founders? Or, can early investors and former employees also participate?
What portion of vested equity are employees eligible to sell? (20% is the median)
What is the minimum tenure (one year is the median)
3) You determine the size of the secondary. 
Consider the eligibility rules and take an informal poll of the largest potential sellers to gauge potential interest. The median size of a secondary is ~20%-30% of the size of the recent primary round.
4) You decide whether to structure the program as a company buyback or a third-party tender offer. 
Third-party tender offer:
Can affect the 409a valuation. The median weighting is ~10% per a recent conversation with Andersen Tax, the largest valuation firm. E.g., if the secondary purchase price is $10/sh. and the baseline 409a is $6/sh. then the 409a will increase by $0.40/sh. to $6.40/sh. 
Company Buyback:
Will not harm 409a valuation.
But, it's less advantageous from a cash perspective because the difference between the secondary purchase price and the 409a is taxed as compensation: 
The employee pays ordinary income tax.
The employee pays payroll tax.
The company pays payroll tax.
The company recognizes compensation expenses on its income statement.
For this reason, there has been a general trend towards third-party tender offers in recent years (see NPM 2018 summary analysis).
5) You decide whether to raise the secondary round from existing investors or to run a process involving new investors for optimal price discovery:
Option 1: Let existing investors do the secondary:
There are about a dozen firms in Silicon Valley whose business model is to get onto the cap table, get cozy with management, and then try to get a 10%-30% discount to market value on secondary shares. Notable names are Tiger, Coatue, Glynn, Industry, Akkadian, 137, Dragoneer, Greenspring, Founders Circle.
Your current Board members can also be persuasive if their firm wants to buy the secondary shares to increase its stake in your company. You answer to them. So, it can be tough to turn down their pitch which is: 
Avoid the hassle of running a secondary process.
Leave it within the family. Don't go to new investors.
So, take our offer to do it at a [10%-30%] discount
Option 2: Run a competitive process to raise the secondary:
Several companies do this: Nasdaq Private Market, Carta, and Solium. Each charges a 2%-4% fee which pays for itself several times over with the more effective price discovery. The sellers only pay this fee if they decide to tender. The company pays nothing. 
My favorite agent is Nasdaq. They've been doing it the longest and have the most experienced operational team. They've managed >250 private company secondary liquidity programs to quote numbers, which have provided > $20 billion of liquidity to > 30,000 individual employees, founders, and investors.
You can exclude any investors you don't want in the process upfront.
There's minimal incremental effort by the company. The data room is already prepared. There may be a few ~60-minute meetings with investors who have expressed a formal indication of interest.
The agent runs a competitive auction for optimal price discovery. You can also invite existing investors to participate. The same fair rules apply to all parties. 
The agent will do an employee town hall to explain how they achieved a competitive pricing process. On the contrary, employees can be skeptical if a company must explain that a pricing deal was struck privately with a company insider.
You can get significant input on this from your outside counsel. They will have seen many of these programs. 
A company within my portfolio recently did a secondary tender offer using NPM. I asked the CEO for his reaction to the NPM service. His response:
""We found it to be a cautious OK. It was a fair amount of work to use, and the interface is quite clunky. Apparently Carta is working on a competitive product, which our team is excited to use if / when we do it again."" ","Late-stage private companies use liquidity programs to retain employees and avoid premature IPO pressure, with CEOs setting rules and structure."
"Listening Tours, by Ian Tien (5 min)",https://medium.com/@it33/leadership-listening-tours-llts-for-remote-work-22b236ca2d16 ,"Missing hallway conversations? Try Remote Listening Tours (RLTs)
Remote Listening Tours (“RLTs”) help remote leaders get a better sense of how people are thinking, feeling and operating.
Ian Tien


In the 1970s, there was a management technique catching on called Managing By Wandering Around (“MBWA”), where senior executives would wander around buildings to talk to employees to get a sense of how organizations were thinking, feeling and operating.

With remote work, leaders lose their ability to wander. Because of this, we’re more prone to getting isolated from our organizations, to losing context, and to limiting our perspectives to filtered reports and meeting commentary.

To do our version of wandering remotely, at Mattermost we use Remote Listening Tours (“RLTs”). RLTs are skip-level small group conversations where leaders, particularly the CEO, can hear feedback and input from a handful of people on a semi-random cadence. RLTs give leaders a sense of sentiment, alignment, and more context on what’s on people’s minds. Personally, these meetings are some of the most impactful conversations that I have in a week.

The original concept was shared to us by one of our investors who used it in an in-office environment, and we adjusted it for remote work.

Below I’m sharing some adapted documentation on how we do CEO Listening Tours for our company, in case this could be helpful to yours:

CEO Listening Tour (sample documentation)
The following documentation is shared to our staff in advance. It’s also shared in the meeting invite for the Listening Tour. If it’s helpful, please feel free to use and adapt it.

Listening to feedback and input is vital to continually improving everything we do. We want to listen a lot. We have 1–1s with managers and skip-levels, regular pulse and engagement surveys, People team outreach and conversations, and anonymous feedback available in every all-hands meeting.

CEO Listening Tours are another way we listen.

CEO Listening Tours happen over video calls around 25 to 30 minutes in length with different groups of 5 to 8 staff, typically within the same department or in a related function. Managers of team members in the group are typically not included in the meeting. It’s a time set aside for the CEO to listen directly to colleagues across the company.

Some notes about Listening Tours:

It’s an opportunity to hear from staff about their likes and wishes. What’s one thing you like that’s happening? What’s one thing you wish we might do differently? Likes and wishes could be about your team, your department or the company in general. These could be items off the top of your head, or maybe something you’ve been thinking about for a while. No need to over think things. There’s no wrong answer, this is just a chance for people to share thoughts with the group.
The priority of the meeting is listening. During these sessions the CEO takes notes and refrains from commentary, though may ask follow-up questions. Notes are “default open” to be shared with managers, executives, and anyone in the company.
We end by confirming people are heard. At the end of the session the CEO reads back what they heard to verify people’s input was accurately captured, and to see if there’s more to share. The notes are shared with the management chain who weren’t in the meeting. It’s up to managers to decide if they’d like to ask for more feedback based on the likes and wishes shared, or if any adjustments should be made. The CEO may also incorporate the information at the company level. In the past, participants and managers of listening tours have found the meetings productive for uncovering blindspots at the company and within departments.
If you’re not able to make a particular listening meeting, please ping [coordinator contact] to add you to a different slot.

That’s roughly we how we do ours at the time of this writing. We continually adjust our process as we go. There’s lots of articles on in-person listening tours to draw from as you hone your own version.

Personally, I don’t think there’s a full substitute for managing by walking around — technology is still far from replacing in-person experiences. However, I do believe management is a profession, and the better tools we have to ply our craft, the better our results can be.

My hope is Remote Listening Tours might offer an idea or two for remote managers.

Does your company do some form of remote listening tour today? Would love to hear your feedback in comments. What do you like about how your company listens? What do you wish they might do differently?

UPDATE: To add: It’s important to over-communicate about Remote Listening Tours, in email, at an all-hands meeting, in the meeting invite, and in a pre-amble at the start of each session. Especially if you have senior leaders doing skip levels, or skip-skip levels, etc. you want to make sure people have context on the meeting and aren’t surprised.","Remote Listening Tours (RLTs) help remote leaders connect with employees, fostering feedback and insights crucial for effective management and communication."
Lord of the Flies (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFeiiqbU0-T8wkvNAU9LG2WA-yrl9vomLkcrZfQZTqk/edit# ,"Lord of the Flies (1 min)

Inevitably, conflict arises in any organization. When it does, it is up to you to teach your team members how to give and receive non-violent feedback and ensure that they do.
Many managers do not enjoy dealing with people in conflict, and therefore instead say, ""You two, work it out amongst yourselves."" But unless your team is already proficient at non-violent communication and radical candor, then the two will likely not be able to work it out on their own. If you continue to stay at arms-length, the result will be … Lord of the Flies. The absence of governance leads to civil war. This is not healthy.
To stop this behavior, you must step in to adjudicate when your team members cannot work it out on their own. Give them one chance to do so. If they cannot, then step in to decide the issue or mediate the conflict. If you don't want to do it yourself, hire a coach to teach and facilitate the feedback sessions. Whatever you do, do not simply leave the participants on their own to work it out. If you do, you will be responsible for the emotional bloodshed that ensues.
","Managers must address conflicts in teams by teaching non-violent feedback. Ignoring issues can lead to destructive outcomes like ""Lord of the Flies."""
Loudest voice in the room (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKJnyxUZDOcPQF0VtERizzyvKgBiqwOA7aL2dMcFSdw/edit ,"Loudest voice in the room (1 min)
(This writing was inspired by a conversation with Anthony Ghosn, CEO of Shogun.)
Whenever you choose to use Method 3 to get full buy-in, know that, as CEO, your voice will be the ""loudest in the room."" To get full buy-in, you will have to elicit people's most genuine thoughts. Once people hear your perspective, some percentage will naturally alter their views to more closely match yours. This % is much higher than you might imagine. People assume that as CEO, you have more information than they do, and therefore your perspective is probably more correct. Later, these same people will not feel fully bought-in to the outcome, because internally they will know that their true thought was not heard. 
So, to get the full benefit of your team's knowledge and make sure that they get to full buy-in, be careful not to ""tip your hand"" before all others have shared theirs. The most effective way to do this is to either have people write down their vote or thoughts before you share your perspective. Or by having everyone give a simultaneous thumbs-up/thumbs-down vote.
For an excellent example of this phenomenon and the solution, CJ Reim of Amity Ventures pointed me to 13 Days by Robert F Kennedy about the Cuban Missile Crisis.
From Peter Reinhardt, CEO and co-founder of Segment: ""Apparently at Amazon, they require the most junior people to speak and ask questions first. Also becomes a great way to show off junior talent, give more senior folks a chance to observe and give feedback, etc.""","CEO's voice is influential in decision-making. To ensure full team buy-in, withhold your opinion until all perspectives are shared."
Love Meeting (5 min including video),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcZz5WQlIzIhRWL37Knha6eutCkBMXv8KAIFZl5IdPs/edit ,"Love Meeting (5 min including video)        
People who feel emotions strongly (anger, fear, sadness) need an effective way to release those emotions. One of the most effective ways is to speak aloud for a few minutes about what is causing them anger, fear, or sadness. Once they do this, much of the emotion is released, and they feel better. 
Most people benefit from such a release after a long day of living (work, kids, etc.). If you have a spouse or a partner, one of the greatest gifts you can give them is an offer to be the listener for such a release. 
If you make such an offer and it is accepted, the key is to be ""present"" while your partner talks and not interject with suggestions or advice. If you give advice, you kill the person's stream of consciousness and end the release. This action is very frustrating for the talker. They don't want solutions; they just want to release. 
So, your only job during such a session is to listen actively.  
In its most basic form, active listening is: 
Being present 
Turn off all devices (phone, laptop, etc.)
Look at the person talking
Breath


Not interjecting 
Do not talk! 
Do not give advice or suggestions. 
Just listen!
In a more advanced form, you can show that you hear both the words and their emotions. When your partner expresses something frustrating, allow yourself to feel the frustration and allow your face to reflect that emotion. Similarly, for sadness, anger, and fear, or whatever emotion they are expressing.
As the listener, it may feel daunting to be present and listen for an indeterminate amount of time. What if your partner keeps talking for hours? The answer, of course, is that they won't. Usually, after 10-15 minutes, your partner will likely be talked out, emotionally released, and feeling much better (and feeling connected to you!). 
The first time you do this, I recommend that you just let it go as long as it needs to. If you decide to make this a regular part of your life, know that it will require less and less time over time.
For a visual demonstration of what to and not to do (and why), watch this 2-minute video called Nail in the Head.
I call such a listening meeting a Love Meeting. My wife and I do it regularly. And it magically creates a deep connection between us.
","Expressing emotions aloud for a few minutes helps release anger, fear, and sadness. Active listening without advice fosters emotional release and connection."

"Make Money, Have Fun, Do Good (2 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_8WALoefgBCQ9cR0Jgwztt_8-ppjJ1r7zpeyoikTa0/edit?folder=0B9tanFUuwmYSMHIyU2pkYTZSVkU ,"Make Money, Have Fun, Do Good (2 min)
When I joined Spectrum Equity Investors after business school, many friends and friends of friends began reaching out to me for career advice. The ploy was a thin one. They wanted a job at Spectrum. There was no such job available to them, but I earnestly gave them career advice. They each said they wanted a position where they could ""make money, have fun and do good."" I replied: ""Great, but if you had to choose just one of those, which would it be?"" The answer was inevitably: ""Make money."" I then told them to optimize only for that variable. If they tried to optimize for all three, they'd end up in a place that provided none.
After giving this advice over and over, I realized that I needed to follow it myself. So I started my own company, and 18 months later, I was lucky enough to have amassed more wealth than I knew what to do with. 
Having checked the box of Make Money, I could now turn my attention to Have Fun. I made it my full-time job. And I became very good at it. I did it for three years straight until I had had so much fun that I was over it. 
Now what? Well, Do Good seemed the next logical step. And to me, this didn't mean giving money to charities. It meant doing the really dirty work: Helping people that others were afraid to. To me, that meant helping hard-core criminals in the US. And that's when I decided to set up the Mochary Foundation.
The problem that I discovered was this: Millions of formerly incarcerated Americans struggle to get jobs because every employer can easily do a background check, and the vast majority of employers will not hire someone with a criminal record if there is another candidate available. That leaves formerly incarcerated people with almost no way of making legitimate money. But they still need to eat. So, they do whatever they have to in order to eat. And this often leads them right back to prison.
The solution, in my opinion, is a short vocational training program for high-skill jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified candidates. At the Mochary Foundation, this is what we do: train x-convicts to get their Commercial Driver's License. Within days of getting their license, they are usually driving a truck for over $50,000/year, and suddenly their future seems stable and tenable. And then they want to help the next x-convict by paying back the cost of their training, plus the cost of two more. This makes the whole operation self-funding.
I very much enjoyed the feeling of success in making money. That good feeling lasted about a week. Then I very much enjoyed having fun. I was good at it, and it lasted for years. But when I finally started to change lives by doing good, I felt something that I'd never felt before: deep satisfaction. And it is the best feeling that I have ever experienced.
It is a feeling that I wish upon you. And if you know that you will eventually get there, there is no reason to wait as I did. 
You can start the ball rolling sooner by having your company do Pledge 1% or personally doing Founder's Pledge. Or both! You will not regret it. And your action will be leveraged, as it will be an inspiration to others.","The author shares advice on prioritizing making money, having fun, and doing good, leading to founding a foundation to help ex-convicts."
Making the Offer (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDbshCFwd19_6Ke__-0klE-BYJdJympMMprybTIp1bg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Making the Offer (1 min)


If you make a written offer to a candidate that you love, hoping that they will accept, they may well do so. But they will also be tempted to ask for a few more things before accepting (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. 
To keep the offer and acceptance process entirely positive, do the following:
Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:
""I will join the company as long as ….""
They will (hopefully) state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.
Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:
""If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?""
If they say yes, then invite them in to make the offer in person. The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. I recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Here are some possibilities:
Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
Give company swag. 
Give hugs and high-fives. 
Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable. If you do this, the relationship will begin with a resoundingly positive ""Yes! Thank you! I'm so excited!""

Note: Senior execs will always require that their attorney review the offer before they accept. That is fine. In advance of making the offer, you can share the language of the contract and all the details except for the compensation (income and equity).
","To ensure a positive job offer process, communicate openly with candidates about their requirements and make the acceptance memorable."
Manager:  How to be a great one! (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-_LkABTtV1bmZ287NtinvFhr74Yl3DXzDYdG_zff2qc/edit ,"Manager:  How to be a great one! (1 min)
What is the goal of a manager? To make your team maximally productive.
How then do you make your team maximally productive? 
The primary thing is to create an environment that allows for maximum productivity. To me, this means that each person is:
Feeling joy in their work life. 
Feeling joy in their personal life. I know this seems beyond the scope of a manager from work. It is not. 
Feeling joy about how the company operates.
Feeling joy about their interaction with their manager (you!).
Feely joy about their interaction with other team members.
The easiest way to help people achieve this joy is to ask them where they are (I like to use a number scale from 1-5) and then ask them what a 5 would look like. For more detail, see the ""magic questions"" in Motivating your team (2 min).
To get real answers, you'll first have to create trust. The easiest way that I know to do that is to
Show that you care about who they are as a person. Do this by asking about the things that matter to them in their personal lives, and then remember what they said and ask them about it in future conversations. Keep doing this for several minutes at the beginning of each meeting (whether 1-1 or group). 


Show that you recognize the good work that they are doing. Do this by pointing out the things they have done that you like. 
If you don't know what they are doing, don't worry. Simply ask them: ""What are the things that you have done since our last meeting that you are proud of?"" And then praise the person for those things.
Once you have created the trust and are getting honest answers to the Magic Questions, you will be able to help them create a near 10. Then you can look at their work and see if they are actually applying the needed time to be maximally productive (the quantity of time they are applying is near a 5).
To create and maintain the information flow needed, you should do both regular 1-1s and team meetings. The 1-1s should be prepared for the team meeting so that the team meeting is maximally effective.
These meetings should start with a weekly cadence to build rapport and create norms around communicating. But once you start showing up to meetings, and there is not enough new content to talk about, then it's time to drop the cadence to bi-weekly. This feels like the best cadence for ongoing 1-1s and team meetings. For those people who work exceptionally well without guidance, you can drop the 1-1s to monthly. 
And that's it.  ","Managers maximize team productivity by creating a joyful environment, building trust, recognizing good work, and maintaining regular communication."

You have discovered a way to disrupt a massive legacy market. You are the first to go after this opportunity, and you want to get as many customers as you can as fast as you can. Your first instinct is to reach out to any and all potential customers in the space. You may even have the thought that you want a few customers in each geography around the world to ""mark your territory."" Your primary fear is that other competitors will see the same opportunity and move faster than you. 
But history tells a different story. The most significant risk of a startup is not that they moved too slowly in dominating the entire marketplace, but rather that they spread their scarce resources too thin and ended up securing few or no customers at all. 
Every customer already has a legacy solution in place, and those legacy providers are far larger with more resources than you. They have deep and long-standing relationships with their customers. Even if your product or service is better, it needs to be 10x better than the legacy solution for a customer to switch.
Therefore, rather than go after the entire market at once, the key is to find a small segment of the market (i.e., a set of customers with similar pain points) that has a particularly difficult problem for whom your solution is indeed 10x better than the broad non-specific legacy solution. This is your low-hanging fruit. Concentrate all of your efforts on this type of customer to maximize your chance of getting your first few customers. Once you do, you will have a track record to share, raise more money, and hire more engineers to create more features and more salespeople to develop more relationships. Continue focusing on this first type of customer until you have secured many (if not most) of them as your customers. Then use your now-larger amount of resources to move to the next lowest hanging fruit. 
A good analogy is the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. The Germans held the whole coastline. The Allies could have chosen to spread their invading force along the entire shore. If they had, they would have had one boat per beach. The Germans' pillboxes would have slaughtered each and every Allied soldier that landed on a French beach. 
That, of course, is not what the Allies did. Instead, they studied the coastline and found the beach that was the least well-defended (Omaha Beach in Normandy). They concentrated most of their forces on that one target beachhead and could overwhelm the German defenses there and secure the toe-hold they needed. From there, the Allies were able to bring in more resources, expand out, and eventually spread throughout Europe.
Do the same. Study the marketplace. Segment it into different customer types. Determine which segment is the least satisfied with their current solution and for whom your solution is the best fit. Concentrate all of your sales and engineering efforts toward this segment. Land a few of these customers. Continue to focus on this segment until you dominate it. Only then expand to other customer segments (or add other products). 
The best way to choose a target beachhead is to follow the steps outlined in the book Disciplined Entrepreneurship by Bill Aulet. There is no need to reinvent the wheel here; that book outlines the steps clearly. ","Focus on a small market segment with high need for your solution; dominate it before expanding, akin to Allies' WWII strategy."

The Exec Team meeting is a place where the top leaders in the company come together to
Report on the status of all departments, goals, projects, etc
Unpack and solve issues that have arisen
Give each other feedback on behavior
When this meeting gets too large (over eight active participants), an efficient discussion is no longer possible. 
(Note: it is OK to have an unlimited number of observers as long as:
Observers indeed remain observers, i.e., they don't talk unless specifically asked to by the meeting owner.
Active participants don't tone down their comments because observers are present.)
When the number of team leads becomes too large, most companies split into an Exec Meeting and a Team Leads Meeting, as described in Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting (3 min). 
And while this structure is better than a huge meeting with way too many active participants, it does have a weakness. Updates on a project occur without the project lead present. Issues involving teams get decided on without those team leads present. How to solve this?
Francis Davidson at Sonder has figured out how: The ""deconstructed"" exec team meeting!
Here is how it works: Each function of the exec team meeting receives its own meeting (every 2-4 weeks) with the most relevant eight people present.
Each company goal has its own meeting bi-weekly, with the most relevant eight people present. If the company has three goals, this is three bi-weekly meetings. 
Each department has its business review monthly with the most relevant eight people present (and anyone is invited to observe). This is 6-10 monthly meetings.
Each major project has its own monthly review meeting, with the most relevant eight people present. 
At each of these meetings, the participants present (in writing and video in advance, of course, see Writing vs. Talking (and Video)) their wins, the status of their agreed-to actions, the issues and their proposed solutions, and their feedback for each other. Issues get decided. Feedback is processed. Actions get created.
There is no one overall Exec Team meeting. Just deconstructed sub-meetings.
Francis began this process in spring 2021. So far, the results are promising. I will give further updates as I hear them from Francis. 
Here is the complete write up from Sonder of the Sonder Leadership Team Management System.","Exec team meeting deconstructed: smaller, more focused sub-meetings for efficient communication and decision-making, pioneered by Sonder's CEO."

Coaching is declaring:

And then using this framework (Deep Feedback) every quarter.
This level of accountability, coaching, and transparency is best in both directions (from CEO to the company and the company to the CEO) at every level (company, department, team, and individual).
To achieve the best results, initiate a regular series of meetings:
One-on-One 
Team 
Company-wide (All Hands)
Office hours 
Quarterly planning
Each manager should plan to devote an entire day each week to internal meetings. The weekly team meeting will be the longest (up to three hours initially, until teams learn the habit of writing down all input before the meeting when it can get down to 30 minutes). The weekly one-on-one sessions and office hours will consume the remainder of the day. This timing determines how many team members a single manager can effectively oversee. If one of your managers can't fit all the necessary meetings into a single day, she has too many people reporting directly to her, and you need to re-organize, or she needs to run more efficient meetings. 
The overhead—twenty percent of the standard workweek—can feel tremendous to a startup CEO accustomed to the organic information flow of a small group working together in the same room. But without this one-day-per-week investment, a larger team will never fully know what to do, nor will the CEO get the needed feedback on her performance or the company's performance.
Calendar Cadence
Paul Graham of YCombinator, famously points out that makers (engineers) need long stretches of uninterrupted time to be productive, whereas managers are most effective when meeting. The compromise is to schedule days when no meetings are allowed. The schedule that works best for a five-day workweek is:
- 1 day of internal meetings
- 1 day of external meetings (i.e., interviewing candidates)
- 3 meeting-free days
It isn't critical when these days are, although it helps to space the two meeting days apart from each other.
The above schedule often comes under fire from recruiters, who worry that:
It won't be easy to conduct all onsite interviews on a single day.
Many qualified candidates won't be able to make it in on the appointed day.
First, your hire and close rate for candidates should be very high (approx. 75%)— otherwise, you are losing incredible amounts of time by doing all-day in-person interviews with many candidates you don't want to hire or don't want to work for you. Therefore, unless you are already hitting the 75% metric, you should start screening candidates more effectively (i.e., brutally) in your phone interviews and lower the number of in-person interviews.
Second, it is true that some candidates can only come on specific days or times. However, the benefits of having meetings on only one set day, as measured by the company's increased productivity, far outweigh the cost of losing out on a few candidates. Additionally, if the candidate cannot find the time to make it on a set day within two or three weeks, it is likely that they won't take the job anyway.
There are many other high-level candidates out there, and you can find another one. But there are only a finite number of productive work hours within the company. Once lost, there is no way to recapture them.
There are two exceptions to the advice above:
In the very early days of a company, when a department has just one person, the department lead can set a recruiting schedule that works for her as she builds her team. 
Departments that are entirely non-technical and don't require focused work time.
The guidelines above are for when a team is already in place, which requires uninterrupted days for its work. These steps are crucial for the Engineering team.
Meeting Order
When creating the schedule for the day of internal meetings, I recommend the following order:
1-on-1 meetings
Leadership Team Meeting
All Hands Meeting
CEO Open Office Hour
Company-wide social event
The 1-1 meetings are a time to ensure that each report is fully prepared for the team meeting. (As reports begin to prepare thoroughly for their 1-1 meeting in advance, their Accountability and Coaching can be pushed into the Team Meeting, allowing more time for Transparency during the 1-1).
At the Leadership Team meeting, all Issues are surfaced and either resolved or moved to a RAPID decision-making process. Then the Leadership Team can share all the decisions from the meeting at the All Hands meeting. The CEO Open Office Hour (which I highly recommend) can be scheduled anytime in the day. And finally, if you have a regular company social event (which I also recommend), the internal meeting day is a logical day to have it, as this is the day when most of your team will be in the office.
As the company grows, Department meetings (both 1-1s and Team) will likely have to happen on a different day. Just as the 1-1s are prep for the team meeting, the Department meetings are prep for the Leadership meetings. I, therefore, recommend scheduling Department meetings the day before the Leadership meetings.
Meeting Leads
It is essential that each meeting have a designated Meeting Lead, who is sometimes, but not necessarily, the group's manager. This person is responsible for making the meeting run well, which also means ensuring that all meeting participants submit their updates and issues in writing in advance and show up on time. The Meeting Lead must be ruthless about sticking to the timeline and, whenever something off-topic comes up, they should note it but schedule the discussion for another time. Finally, the lead must drive decisions and feedback to action items with DRIs and due dates and record these in the accountability system. 
Without an effective Meeting Lead, meetings quickly become inefficient, and people come to resent them.
One-On-One Meetings
To understand the basis for these meetings, I recommend that all team members read the same book to get on the same page about the purpose and structure of these meetings.
If you manage high-level managers, the best book is Andy Grove's High Output Management. 
If you manage individual contributors who are unlikely to read a long book like High Output Management, ask the team to read The One Minute Manager by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. It's a concise read (30 minutes), and it contains simple, practical advice. Assigning it uniformly to the team will ensure they have a common basis for proceeding.
The first One-On-One Meeting should occur soon after the onboarding process is complete. Have both the manager and the team member come to the meeting with written, measurable OKRs for the new team member. When the manager and team members reach a consensus on a set of OKRs (ideally three or fewer), merge these into one list.
Run subsequent meetings according to the following template. 
Team member:
Accountability (goals and actions): 
Last Week 
For each of your stated actions from last week, did you get them done? Yes/No? 
If No, what blocked you?
What habit can you adopt so that you don't encounter that obstacle again?
Next Week 
For each of your OKRs, what one action can you take to advance toward each of them?
Coaching (issues and solutions): 
Show your OKRs in traffic light fashion (green-yellow-red). 
Green= on-track. 
Yellow= slightly off-track. 
Red= far off-track.
Show your KPIs in a traffic light fashion.
Show any relevant pipelines (Recruiting, Sales, Customer Success, Engineering Roadmap, etc.)
If I were to dig into these updates, what would I discover in your department that is: 
Good
Not Good 
Please describe the Issue in detail, as well as your Proposed Solution. This Proposed Solution should include: 
What you can do to help solve the Issue.
What I (your manager) can do to help unblock you.
Please list any other Issues you see in the company, with peers, with the product, in your own life, etc. 
For each, please list your Proposed Solution. Even if you are unsure of the right course of action, take a stab at a definitive roadmap. It will help advance the conversation. 
Transparency (feedback): 
What did you like that I did as a manager?
What do you wish that I would do differently as a manager? 
Would you please think of the feedback you are afraid to give me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Would you please give me that feedback?
Manager:
Transparency: 
Get feedback from your report. 
Elicit negative feedback about your actions. Do this any way you can. Ask for it, appreciate it, and act on it. These actions are the key to making a team member feel heard and valued.
Once you have gotten critical feedback, either 
Accept 
If you accept, co-create a written action step that you can take to act on it. Put this action step on your group task manager so that your report can see that you actually do it.
Not Accept
In some rare cases, there will be feedback that you do not accept. That is okay, as long as you are clear about why you do not accept the request. 
Give feedback to your report. Declare: 
Since the previous meeting, what actions did your report do that you liked? Be specific.
What actions do you wish that your report would do differently? State these as specific future actions. Example: 
""I wish that you would ask for feedback from your direct reports in your 1-1s.""
Update the team member's goals: 
Ensure that the OKRs are still relevant.
Ensure that their declared actions for the upcoming week are the straightest line to achieving their OKRs.
Ensure that their Proposed Solutions are the straightest line to solving the Issue.
Ensure that they have copied and pasted all of their actions (from OKRs and Issues/Solutions) into the group task manager.
Schedule these meetings regularly, on a fixed day and time. The weekly schedule can be bi-weekly or even monthly once a team member develops expertise at her tasks and if her goals remain consistent over time. Another alternative is to set different paces for Accountability, Coaching, and Transparencies. I.e., Meet weekly for Coaching and Transparency, but do Accountability on a bi-weekly or monthly cadence.
On your day set aside for meetings, schedule One-On-One sessions before the team meeting. Schedule them back-to-back, and allot twenty-five to fifty minutes for each one. If there is a serious issue to discuss, such as profound job dissatisfaction, then use your Open Office Hour (see below) later that day to fully address the issue.
If a team is small enough, you can merge One-On-One and Team Meetings, but be cautious about giving negative feedback in a group setting. Shame is likely to arise unless your team has agreed to radical transparency and actively wants negative public feedback. Most companies, therefore, opt to provide negative feedback only during One-On-One meetings. 
That being said, I do recommend moving to a culture of radical transparency. Doing so will allow you to merge all One-On-One meetings into the Team meeting. This action can save you 4-6 hours on your day of internal meetings.
But radical transparency first requires explicit buy-in from every team member and training in how to do it effectively. Conscious Leadership Group runs excellent 1-day training in radical transparency. The investment of time may seem significant but usually pays for itself within a few weeks (i.e., saving a half-day per week).
Team Meeting
To support the company's quarterly goals, each team must meet weekly (or bi-weekly if the team is very smooth-running) to:
Hold each other accountable for the actions they need to perform
Surface and resolve any issues in the company
Give each other feedback
To ensure participants are prepared for the meeting, I recommend holding all 1-1s in the morning just before the team meeting. The 1-1s then serve as preparation for the team meeting.
During the team meeting, each attendee should:
Report whether they accomplished their declared Actions from the previous meeting. This response should be a simple YES or NO. If NO, they should also write WHY? they didn't do the action. And what HABIT can they adopt to make sure they never encounter that obstacle again? Here is an example: 
Get feedback from Joe. 
NO.
Why? I forgot about it and therefore didn't ask for feedback when I met with Joe.
Habit? Create an Agenda list. Look at this list each time I meet with someone.
Report their department updates 
Show 
Link to traffic-lighted KPIs
Link to traffic-lighted OKRs
The written update should be a deep dive into these metrics to share what has happened that is 
Good
Not Good. 
What exactly is the Issue.
What is your Proposed Solution for correcting the Issue?
Many people will say that they do not know what the solution is and want guidance. That is fine. But the discussion will be much more fruitful if they definitively declare what they THINK the solution is, even if they have very little confidence in their proposal.
Declare what actions they will do until the next meeting: 
Toward their OKRs
As part of Proposed Solutions
Provide feedback to the team leader and peers in the Like and Wish That format. 
Peer to Peer 
Each peer gives feedback to one other peer per meeting (on a rotating basis)
Reports to Manager 
If they did these in the 1-1, it is good to show them in the team meeting.
Manager to Reports 
Only if the company is practicing radical transparency, otherwise this remains in the 1-1
The agenda for the meeting then becomes:
Updates from each team member (1, 2, and 3 from above)
Discuss Issues and Proposed Solutions. 
Time-box each Issue. 
If the team agrees to a solution, turn it into Action Items with DRIs and Due Dates.
If the team does not agree to a Solution, turn the Issue into a RAPID.
Write and review Feedback to each other.
Team Meetings follow the same information flow as the 1-1s: Accountability, Coaching, and Transparency. In fact, as the team is effectively preparing in writing in advance for its meetings, the Accountability and Coaching portion of the 1-1s can be moved to the Team Meeting. This action is actually more effective and efficient, allowing more time during the 1-1s for Transparency.
It is essential to time-box all agenda items so that the meetings don't run on and all issues get addressed. You can complete this step by putting a number before each agenda item. You can indicate five minutes as [5]. At the end of the allotted time, move on. If there are still decisions to be made, create a RAPID. 
It is critical that everyone submit all of their updates, issues, and feedback in writing before the meeting, as discussed in Chapter 8 (""Writing vs. Talking""). This step allows others to read the submissions, make comments, and ask questions before the meeting. This action massively increases information flow and allows for consensus before the team meeting even begins. When done verbally, team meetings that take 3 hours can take 30 minutes (and be more effective) when done in writing.
Open Office Hour 
Each manager should set aside one hour each week for an open office hour, during which anyone can come to introduce an issue. This time ensures that all employees feel heard but limits the time required for the manager to a predictable level.
Company-Wide Meeting
On a cadence that varies between once a week and once a month, it is vital to have a Company-Wide Meeting where the results of the most recent leadership team meeting are shared. Follow the same format. Allow time, as always, for anyone to bring up their issues or provide feedback.
For another perspective, Peter Reinhardt of Segment.io shares: ""We use all hands for sharing across teams of what teams are accomplishing, working on, celebrating wins (reinforce our values), and recognition broadly... plus bringing in customers to talk. I find this much healthier than an obsession with whatever leadership team is talking about (although we do present the board deck + board topics once per quarter).""
Quarterly Offsites

Once a quarter, the leadership team (and eventually the entire company), which consists of all the department heads, should take a day or two to:
The Past. Do a retrospective on the prior quarter 
How did we do against our OKRs and KPIs?
How did we function as a team? (360 Feedback). 
The Future. Plan for the future quarter 
Refresh Vision and Values
Dig into Issues/Proposed Solutions 
Use the Emotions exercise shared in Issue Identification in Chapter 14.
Set the new company OKRs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals).
Refresh the company KPIs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals). 
Bond. Get to know and like each other as human beings. 
Structural activities 
If you really knew me ...
Peer Feedback 
Use the feedback exercise shared in Conflict Resolution in Chapter 14.
Unstructured activities 
Drinks at the bar
Sports, crafts, activities, etc.
Events where spouses are invited.
I recommend scheduling these offsites on a Thursday/Friday so that you can then offer an optional weekend unstructured event with spouses. Team members often would like to get to know each other, but they are waiting for you to organize the events that will allow them to do so.
Vision
To create the ten-year vision, imagine it is ten years from now. You are the dominant company in the industry. Ask yourself:
What industry do you dominate?
Who is your customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
What pain do they have that are you solving for them?
What is unique about the solution that causes the customer to choose you over the competition?
What asset (human or physical) do you control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy your solution? In other words, what is your moat?
Values
There are many ways to create your company values. A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you ….""
OKRs
For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3. Three Objectives with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs). 
The Objective answers the question: ""Where do we want to go?"". Key Results answer the question: ""How do we know that we're getting there?"" 
Here are examples:
Objective- Reach $500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
Key Results- 
Hire 10 additional SDRs.
Hire 5 additional Customer Success agents.
Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team.
Finally, use your Quarterly Goals Meeting to establish near-term actions. Ask yourself: 
""What actions can we take this week to stay on track for each quarterly OKR?"" 
Assign each Action to one person. At your next weekly meeting, the first thing you will do is ask everyone to declare if they completed their assigned Action.
Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Sheet. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an example.
For all OKRs that are far off-track, the DRI must create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.
Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting
As the company grows, each Team will become a large entity (i.e., Biz Ops, Design, Communications, Compliance, etc.). An individual product may grow large enough to warrant becoming a business unit with its own GM. Thus there will be many VP-level execs. You will want to keep them informed and empowered. There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not.
If someone needs to attend a meeting to be informed about what occurs or to have their voice fully represented, in that meeting, you have not yet created a transparent system. 
Each meeting should have clear notes of all updates and decisions made (other than those around compensation and individual performance improvement). The team should publish those notes to the company. So, everyone can know what happened in a meeting without actually attending. In addition, each employee should be encouraged, weekly, to write up any Issues they see in the company, their department, etc., and write up their Proposed Solution as well. Then the team member should elevate these written Issues/Proposed Solutions to the right decision-making meeting with the employee represented in her own written words.
The meeting then becomes a way of making good and fast decisions. 
Your Brain Trust should attend the Leadership Meeting. Who are the key minds that you need to hear from to make significant decisions? And which people run the central business units that you need to make sure are continually unblocked? These should be the attendees of the Leadership Team meeting. Do not add any other attendees to assuage their ego. They will just make the meeting less efficient.
For all the rest of your Department and Team Leads, there is a VPs (or Team Leads) Meeting. At this meeting, VPs announce recent decisions in the Leadership Meeting. There is then a ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment. If any of these decisions will have unintended consequences, now is the time for the VPS to raise their hand and say, ""That is a terrible idea for these reasons …"". The decision then gets kicked into a RAPID. But for the vast majority of decisions, the VPS will be okay with it, and then the decision gets published to the company, likely in All Hands.
To understand the scale of these meetings, I posit that the Leadership Team should be, and remain at, 6-8 people (up to 10 is okay). The VPs Meeting, by contrast, should grow as the company scales. At a company of 1,000 employees, the VPs Meeting often has 15-20 attendees. At Microsoft, this same meeting has over 150 attendees, or so I've been told.

Levels of Meetings
There are 3 levels of meetings based on how much pre-work (pre-reading and pre-writing) is needed prior to the meeting and how much work (sync reading and commenting) is needed during the meeting.


Meeting 1:
Prior to meeting
Nothing
During meeting
First 15 minutes,  I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 2:
Prior to meeting
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting.
For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write.
Pre-meeting
I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.
During meeting
First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 3:
Prior to meeting
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them 24 hours before the meeting.
I ask all to pre-read and pre-comment on each other's updates.
During meeting
We begin the synchronous part of the meeting.","Meetings are crucial for organizational success, focusing on accountability, coaching, and transparency. Various meeting types and structures are detailed."

For an organization to work well, three things must occur at every level of the organization.
Accountability 
Coaching
Transparency
(I use these particular words only because they form an easy-to-remember acronym: ACT)
Accountability is declaring:
A destination (Vision, OKRs, KPIs)
The action steps to get there (Actions)
Whether or not those actions steps were taken (and eventually the goal achieved).
Coaching is declaring:
The current health of the entity (company, department, team, individual). Both the Good and the Not Good.
With the Not Good, describe in detail the Issue and declare a Proposed Solution. (This is where reports can make requests for help from their manager or their peers.)
Transparency is declaring:

Would you please think of the feedback you are afraid to give me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Would you please give me that feedback?
Manager:
Transparency: 
Get feedback from your report. 
Elicit negative feedback about your actions. Do this any way you can. Ask for it, appreciate it, and act on it. These actions are the key to making a team member feel heard and valued.
Once you have gotten critical feedback, either 
Accept 
If you accept, co-create a written action step that you can take to act on it. Put this action step on your group task manager so that your report can see that you actually do it.
Not Accept
In some rare cases, there will be feedback that you do not accept. That is okay, as long as you are clear about why you do not accept the request. 
Give feedback to your report. Declare: 
Since the previous meeting, what actions did your report do that you liked? Be specific.
What actions do you wish that your report would do differently? State these as specific future actions. Example: 
""I wish that you would ask for feedback from your direct reports in your 1-1s.""
Update the team member's goals: 
Ensure that the OKRs are still relevant.
Ensure that their declared actions for the upcoming week are the straightest line to achieving their OKRs.
Ensure that their Proposed Solutions are the straightest line to solving the Issue.
Ensure that they have copied and pasted all of their actions (from OKRs and Issues/Solutions) into the group task manager.
Schedule these meetings regularly, on a fixed day and time. The weekly schedule can be bi-weekly or even monthly once a team member develops expertise at her tasks and if her goals remain consistent over time. Another alternative is to set different paces for Accountability, Coaching, and Transparencies. I.e., Meet weekly for Coaching and Transparency, but do Accountability on a bi-weekly or monthly cadence.
On your day set aside for meetings, schedule One-On-One sessions before the team meeting. Schedule them back-to-back, and allot twenty-five to fifty minutes for each one. If there is a serious issue to discuss, such as profound job dissatisfaction, then use your Open Office Hour (see below) later that day to fully address the issue.
If a team is small enough, you can merge One-On-One and Team Meetings, but be cautious about giving negative feedback in a group setting. Shame is likely to arise unless your team has agreed to radical transparency and actively wants negative public feedback. Most companies, therefore, opt to provide negative feedback only during One-On-One meetings. 
That being said, I do recommend moving to a culture of radical transparency. Doing so will allow you to merge all One-On-One meetings into the Team meeting. This action can save you 4-6 hours on your day of internal meetings.
But radical transparency first requires explicit buy-in from every team member and training in how to do it effectively. Conscious Leadership Group runs excellent 1-day training in radical transparency. The investment of time may seem significant but usually pays for itself within a few weeks (i.e., saving a half-day per week).
Team Meeting
To support the company's quarterly goals, each team must meet weekly (or bi-weekly if the team is very smooth-running) to:
Hold each other accountable for the actions they need to perform
Surface and resolve any issues in the company
Give each other feedback
To ensure participants are prepared for the meeting, I recommend holding all 1-1s in the morning just before the team meeting. The 1-1s then serve as preparation for the team meeting.
During the team meeting, each attendee should:
Report whether they accomplished their declared Actions from the previous meeting. This response should be a simple YES or NO. If NO, they should also write WHY? they didn't do the action. And what HABIT can they adopt to make sure they never encounter that obstacle again? Here is an example: 
Get feedback from Joe. 
NO.
Why? I forgot about it and therefore didn't ask for feedback when I met with Joe.
Habit? Create an Agenda list. Look at this list each time I meet with someone.
Report their department updates 
Show 
Link to traffic-lighted KPIs
Link to traffic-lighted OKRs
The written update should be a deep dive into these metrics to share what has happened that is 
Good
Not Good. 
What exactly is the Issue.
What is your Proposed Solution for correcting the Issue?
Many people will say that they do not know what the solution is and want guidance. That is fine. But the discussion will be much more fruitful if they definitively declare what they THINK the solution is, even if they have very little confidence in their proposal.
Declare what actions they will do until the next meeting: 
Toward their OKRs
As part of Proposed Solutions
Provide feedback to the team leader and peers in the Like and Wish That format. 
Peer to Peer 
Each peer gives feedback to one other peer per meeting (on a rotating basis)
Reports to Manager 
If they did these in the 1-1, it is good to show them in the team meeting.
Manager to Reports 
Only if the company is practicing radical transparency, otherwise this remains in the 1-1
The agenda for the meeting then becomes:
Updates from each team member (1, 2, and 3 from above)
Discuss Issues and Proposed Solutions. 
Time-box each Issue. 
If the team agrees to a solution, turn it into Action Items with DRIs and Due Dates.
If the team does not agree to a Solution, turn the Issue into a RAPID.
Write and review Feedback to each other.
Team Meetings follow the same information flow as the 1-1s: Accountability, Coaching, and Transparency. In fact, as the team is effectively preparing in writing in advance for its meetings, the Accountability and Coaching portion of the 1-1s can be moved to the Team Meeting. This action is actually more effective and efficient, allowing more time during the 1-1s for Transparency.
It is essential to time-box all agenda items so that the meetings don't run on and all issues get addressed. You can complete this step by putting a number before each agenda item. You can indicate five minutes as [5]. At the end of the allotted time, move on. If there are still decisions to be made, create a RAPID. 
It is critical that everyone submit all of their updates, issues, and feedback in writing before the meeting, as discussed in Chapter 8 (""Writing vs. Talking""). This step allows others to read the submissions, make comments, and ask questions before the meeting. This action massively increases information flow and allows for consensus before the team meeting even begins. When done verbally, team meetings that take 3 hours can take 30 minutes (and be more effective) when done in writing.
Open Office Hour 
Each manager should set aside one hour each week for an open office hour, during which anyone can come to introduce an issue. This time ensures that all employees feel heard but limits the time required for the manager to a predictable level.
Company-Wide Meeting
On a cadence that varies between once a week and once a month, it is vital to have a Company-Wide Meeting where the results of the most recent leadership team meeting are shared. Follow the same format. Allow time, as always, for anyone to bring up their issues or provide feedback.
For another perspective, Peter Reinhardt of Segment.io shares: ""We use all hands for sharing across teams of what teams are accomplishing, working on, celebrating wins (reinforce our values), and recognition broadly... plus bringing in customers to talk. I find this much healthier than an obsession with whatever leadership team is talking about (although we do present the board deck + board topics once per quarter).""
Quarterly Offsites

Once a quarter, the leadership team (and eventually the entire company), which consists of all the department heads, should take a day or two to:
The Past. Do a retrospective on the prior quarter 
How did we do against our OKRs and KPIs?
How did we function as a team? (360 Feedback). 
The Future. Plan for the future quarter 
Refresh Vision and Values
Dig into Issues/Proposed Solutions 
Use the Emotions exercise shared in Issue Identification in Chapter 14.
Set the new company OKRs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals).
Refresh the company KPIs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals). 
Bond. Get to know and like each other as human beings. 
Structural activities 
If you really knew me ...
Peer Feedback 
Use the feedback exercise shared in Conflict Resolution in Chapter 14.
Unstructured activities 
Drinks at the bar
Sports, crafts, activities, etc.
Events where spouses are invited.
I recommend scheduling these offsites on a Thursday/Friday so that you can then offer an optional weekend unstructured event with spouses. Team members often would like to get to know each other, but they are waiting for you to organize the events that will allow them to do so.
Vision
To create the ten-year vision, imagine it is ten years from now. You are the dominant company in the industry. Ask yourself:
What industry do you dominate?
Who is your customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
What pain do they have that are you solving for them?
What is unique about the solution that causes the customer to choose you over the competition?
What asset (human or physical) do you control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy your solution? In other words, what is your moat?
Values
There are many ways to create your company values. A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you ….""
OKRs
For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3. Three Objectives with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs). 
The Objective answers the question: ""Where do we want to go?"". Key Results answer the question: ""How do we know that we're getting there?"" 
Here are examples:
Objective- Reach $500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
Key Results- 
Hire 10 additional SDRs.
Hire 5 additional Customer Success agents.
Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team.
Finally, use your Quarterly Goals Meeting to establish near-term actions. Ask yourself: 
""What actions can we take this week to stay on track for each quarterly OKR?"" 
Assign each Action to one person. At your next weekly meeting, the first thing you will do is ask everyone to declare if they completed their assigned Action.
Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Sheet. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an example.
For all OKRs that are far off-track, the DRI must create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.
Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting
As the company grows, each Team will become a large entity (i.e., Biz Ops, Design, Communications, Compliance, etc.). An individual product may grow large enough to warrant becoming a business unit with its own GM. Thus there will be many VP-level execs. You will want to keep them informed and empowered. There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not.
If someone needs to attend a meeting to be informed about what occurs or to have their voice fully represented, in that meeting, you have not yet created a transparent system. 
Each meeting should have clear notes of all updates and decisions made (other than those around compensation and individual performance improvement). The team should publish those notes to the company. So, everyone can know what happened in a meeting without actually attending. In addition, each employee should be encouraged, weekly, to write up any Issues they see in the company, their department, etc., and write up their Proposed Solution as well. Then the team member should elevate these written Issues/Proposed Solutions to the right decision-making meeting with the employee represented in her own written words.
The meeting then becomes a way of making good and fast decisions. 
Your Brain Trust should attend the Leadership Meeting. Who are the key minds that you need to hear from to make significant decisions? And which people run the central business units that you need to make sure are continually unblocked? These should be the attendees of the Leadership Team meeting. Do not add any other attendees to assuage their ego. They will just make the meeting less efficient.
For all the rest of your Department and Team Leads, there is a VPs (or Team Leads) Meeting. At this meeting, VPs announce recent decisions in the Leadership Meeting. There is then a ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment. If any of these decisions will have unintended consequences, now is the time for the VPS to raise their hand and say, ""That is a terrible idea for these reasons …"". The decision then gets kicked into a RAPID. But for the vast majority of decisions, the VPS will be okay with it, and then the decision gets published to the company, likely in All Hands.
To understand the scale of these meetings, I posit that the Leadership Team should be, and remain at, 6-8 people (up to 10 is okay). The VPs Meeting, by contrast, should grow as the company scales. At a company of 1,000 employees, the VPs Meeting often has 15-20 attendees. At Microsoft, this same meeting has over 150 attendees, or so I've been told.

Levels of Meetings
There are 3 levels of meetings based on how much pre-work (pre-reading and pre-writing) is needed prior to the meeting and how much work (sync reading and commenting) is needed during the meeting.


Meeting 1:
Prior to meeting
Nothing
During meeting
First 15 minutes,  I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 2:
Prior to meeting
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting.
For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write.
Pre-meeting
I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.
During meeting
First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 3:
Prior to meeting
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them 24 hours before the meeting.
I ask all to pre-read and pre-comment on each other's updates.
During meeting
We begin the synchronous part of the meeting.

Meetings:  don’t schedule them (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJ7rk_XKsOQEQqN4pGTIvc4quBCuh6p4LtmCqNFs0e4/edit ,"Meetings:  don’t schedule them (1 min)

The two most available people that I know are Sam Altman and Naval Ravikant.  At any time of day, if I reach out to them, they respond near-instantly and are usually available for a 5-minute phone chat if needed.

How is this possible?  These are two of the most successful people on the planet.  Shouldn’t their time be massively scheduled?  

No.  Sam and Naval both use the same method.  They don’t schedule meetings.  

This leaves their calendar almost entirely open.  And that allows them to be able to respond and talk to anyone at any time.  And it allows them to talk to many more people, because each conversation usually only requires 3-5 minutes.  

But if they were to schedule calls, those same calls would be 25 minutes.  The scheduling would also rob Sam and Naval of the flexibility to do what they want to, when they want to.

If someone wants to reach Sam or Naval, that person need only message them and say “Sam, I’d like to talk to you about ______.  Do you have a few minutes to talk now?”   If the subject is interesting to Sam, and he is free, he will call the person right then and there.  

So, if you want the freedom to do what you want when you want to, and be much more available to the world, then … don’t schedule meetings!

Video of Matt explaining how to make meetings effective and efficient (5 min)

Meetings are a necessary evil. But only a tiny part of meetings are essential (ie- need to be done synchronously). The rest actually is evil (ie- can be done asynchronously).
IMHO, there are steps to making all meetings effective and efficient:
Assign a Meeting Owner to every meeting
Determine the Desired Outcome for every meeting
Determine what Asynchronous Preparation can be done
Enforce that this asynchronous work is completed. 
Time-box the synchronous agenda.
Drive to Actions. And write down all Actions with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and due date.
Track all actions in an action-tracker.
Collect written Feedback on the meeting itself.
Meeting Owner
Without a Meeting Owner, there will be a tragedy of the commons. Unless one person is responsible for making them happen, all of the other necessary ingredients of a successful meeting will not occur, as no one will feel authorized to grab the ball.
Here is a cheat sheet for the Meeting Owner: Meeting guidance sheet (1 min)
Desired Outcome
What is the actual purpose of this meeting? This should be clearly stated and written down. At the end of each meeting, each participant should state (in writing) whether the purpose was achieved. 
Most meetings don't declare a purpose, and therefore become arenas for people to hear themselves talk. I call those … Board Meetings.
Asynchronous Preparation
Much of a meeting can be done asynchronously. Any status update, declaration of an issue to be solved, pipeline to be reviewed … can all be written and shared in advance, allowing others to read and comment on them even before the meeting begins.
Enforcement
While it is true that much of the meeting prep can be done asynchronously, that doesn't mean that everyone will do it. This is where the Meeting Owner creates value: enforcement. My preferred process is to show people how to do things in a group setting before asking them to do it on their own in advance. Here's what I mean …

Meeting 1:  		(usually 2 hours)
Prior to meeting 
Nothing


During meeting 
First 15 minutes,  I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
Meeting 2:  		(usually 1.5 hours)
Prior to meeting 
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting. 
For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write. 


Pre-meeting 
I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.


During meeting 
First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
Meeting 3:  		(usually 50 minutes or less)
Prior to meeting 
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them 24 hours before the meeting.
I ask all to pre-read and pre-comment on each other's updates.


During meeting 
We begin the synchronous part of the meeting.
If there is someone in the group who has difficulty pre-writing 24 hours before the meeting, I don't shame them. Instead, we move back to Meeting 2 format. This stage is where most teams end up.
Time-box
Certain things must be done synchronously. 
Personal connection. 
If a team is fully remote, then informal chat about personal lives rarely happens. I like to build in 5 minutes of this in a hyper-efficient way by asking each participant to take 30 seconds to share a highlight from their personal lives. 
Without this step or something like it, teams will lose personal connection and trust over time.
Further reading 
Trust: How to create it among peers (2 min)
Issue. 
When someone presents an Issue, I want to hear them describe it verbally so that I can know what emotion they are experiencing (fear, anger, joy, excitement, etc.), as I am likely to trust their Proposed Solution much more if they are experiencing the positive emotions that lead to brain activity in the pre-frontal cortex. 
Further reading 
Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min)


As Decision-Maker, I want to ask questions of those who made comments that didn't agree 100% with the Proposed Solution. (This ensures that all commenters feel heard.)


Critical feedback. 
While we give it as a gift, it is not always received that way. I want to know how it is received in real-time so that if the recipient gets triggered I can jump in and declare that I did not intend to anger them. 
So, we do these things synchronously, but we don't let them last forever. Instead, we time-box each item. 
For Issues, I give them 5-20 minutes of verbal discussion depending on their importance. If a clear-cut decision cannot be made in that time, I ask the Decision-Maker to declare what further information they need, assign people to get that information, and then declare a new date/time when we can digest it and make a decision made.
For Critical Feedback, I usually give five minutes per presenter. If we are doing paired feedback, I give that ten minutes. If we are doing hot seat feedback (everyone providing feedback to one person), I give that five minutes per presenter. For this reason, I prefer Paired Feedback as we can get feedback to everyone in the room (even if there are 20 people) in just 10 minutes.
Write down all Actions
This step is where most meetings fail. People are so relieved to have gotten to a decision on Issues that they fail to take the final step of writing down every Action, assigning each action to one person (people can work collaboratively, but there must be one person who reports whether the Action got done or not) and a due date. Make sure your Meeting Owner completes this final step. It is the difference-maker.
Tracker
Once actions get written down, track them (in ClickUp, Monday, Asana, a Google Sheet, or Notion). Then in future meetings, check this tracker. This step will remind everyone of their Actions and give all the confidence that they are being done.
If you don't have an Action-Tracker and question the need for one, please read Agreement-Tracker: why you need one (3 min).
Feedback
Every meeting I have, whether 1-1, Team or Board, I always ask for written feedback. It usually takes 2-3 minutes to give. I make it the very last agenda item so that people can leave as soon as they finish writing. 
Giving this feedback makes people feel heard, which gets them to fully participate in future meetings. It also gives me valuable advice on how to make the meeting better.
If I don't ask for feedback, people don't give it. They still have thoughts about improving the meeting, but they withhold those thoughts and then build up resentment toward me. Asking for feedback instantly bleeds off that resentment.

The pushback that I get on asynchronous prep is: ""This takes a long time to do. Isn't this just making the meeting longer?"" 
My answer is: 
""No. While the prep does take a while, the other participants' ability to ingest the material goes up by 5x, making the synchronous meeting itself that much shorter and the quality of the outcome that much greater. Written prep also ensures that everyone has a voice, not just those who are bold. This awareness creates buy-in and boosts morale significantly.
If async prep is too hard to enforce, stick with a Meeting 1 format, where people write and read in real-time during the meeting. That is far more effective than verbal only.""","Matt explains how to optimize meetings for effectiveness and efficiency, emphasizing assigning roles, setting goals, and utilizing asynchronous preparation."

It is relatively easy to monitor a one-time task. Delegate it to someone, put it in a Task Tracker (ClickUp, Asana, Monday, etc.), and then check to see if and when it gets done.
But how to monitor a process? One with never-ending new tasks. Like a Recruiting firm meant to hire for a role. Or a Project or Business Unit's performance. Or the interaction between two tightly coupled Departments (i.e., Engineering and Product, or Sales and Marketing)
The answer is a regular Review Meeting.
For Recruiting, I schedule a 15-minute check-in once a week with the Recruiting firm where we look at the Candidate Pipeline (in a Google Sheet or Notion) and:
Debrief each candidate that I have met so far
Get briefed on each candidate that I have yet to meet
Write down the next Actions and DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each candidate
For a Project or Business Unit, I schedule a monthly 50-minute Review Meeting where the Project of Business Owner walks me through:
Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review and the results of those Actions
The current state of the Project/Business (Green, Yellow, Red), both 
the Good
the Issues the have come up, and their Proposed Solutions
What Actions do they plan to take in the next 30 days
For the interaction between two Departments that work closely together and, therefore, where there is often tension, rather than let that tension build into crisis, I schedule a monthly 80-minute Review where each Department head declares:
Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review
What has worked well in the partnership in the previous 30 days
What has not worked well, and a Proposed Solution to fix it
Together, we then decide on Actions
If you want to ensure that these meetings are as effective and efficient as possible, ask all participants to submit their updates to you in writing in advance. It is still important to hear them verbally present (because you can only hear emotional undertone verbally). Still, the presentation will be more information-rich and efficient if they have written it (and you have read it) ahead of time.","Regular review meetings are essential for monitoring ongoing processes like recruiting, projects, and department interactions, ensuring accountability and progress."

If you contracted a serious illness (i.e., pneumonia) or sustained a serious injury (i.e., broken bones), would you feel embarrassed to seek medical attention? Or rather, would you feel ashamed not to seek medical attention? 
As a society, we accept that the body gets run down at times, and when it does, the responsible action is to seek resources to heal it. 
The mind is no different. It gets run down sometimes. There is no shame in it. It happens to everyone that I know (who is honest about it). And just as with physical ailments, if we ignore mental ailments, they sometimes get better on their own. But much more often, they don't. So, we can either ignore those mental ailments because we believe that it shows weakness to admit that we have them or seek resources to heal them. Which sounds more reasonable to you?

Attention to detail is one of the most commonly desired traits for new hires. But how can you tell if your own attention to detail has tipped into micromanagement? Ask your direct reports. 

Not ready to do that? As a prior micromanager myself, I usually recognize it in leaders when they’re:


Excessively involved in processes and functions below their pay grade — beyond the healthy norms of management
Reluctant to delegate
Hyper-focused on the details

The Root of Micromanagement
As with changing any behavior, it’s critical to first understand the underlying motivating factors that drive that behavior — consciously or unconsciously. For micromanaging, it’s:

A lack of trust
You don’t trust others to get it done [right] and often check to make sure they actually did it. Plus, how productive are they really?
Need to control
You hate it when decisions are made without you, and want constant updates on progress.
Perfectionism
You obsess over details and don’t want to delegate because they won’t do it as well as you.
Fear of losing power/influence
You want to stay involved, so you limit others’ power/authority.
Lack of confidence in team members
You often ignore team members’ feedback and are quick to take back work as soon as a problem arises.

Lo and behold, fear is often at the root of all of this. And you know by now that fear and anger give bad advice.

Diminishing Returns
The story we micromanagers tell ourselves is that it’s for the greater good. But here’s the ugly truth: leaders who micromanage:

Burn out at a higher rate
Experience lower trust, candor and transparency with direct reports
See a higher turnover rates with employees and increased costs due to ongoing hiring
Create work cultures with higher levels of stress, burnout, depression, complacency, lower productivity and lower engagement

When You Know Better, You Do Better
When I micromanaged, I thought I was helping by bringing my experience to bear to help solve whatever problem was at hand. But as a leader, I needed to shift my focus from the problem/work to the person. 

I leaned into figuring out what the underlying gaps were in my direct reports’ processes — not in the issue/problem/work itself.

By channeling my energy into supporting my people in addressing the underlying gaps in their processes, they not only solved the problem at hand; they were empowered to solve 100,000 problems going forward!

If you hired well, you have a strong leadership team around you, all with different strengths, skills and zones of genius from you. What's stopping you from delegating more to them? From leading in a way that helps your direct reports shine?

Not sure where to begin? Identify where you feel the greatest urge to micromanage (e.g. trust, wanting to control, perfectionism, fear of losing power/influence, lack of confidence) and reverse-engineer your solution from how you contributed to the problem. Try our Issue/Proposed Solution approach:
Issue: 


A detailed description of what the problem or challenge is.


I helped create this situation by:
If you make an honest effort to declare how you contributed to creating the situation, then others will not feel blamed, and you will likely see a way that you can unwind the problem without relying on others to do so.
Proposed solution:
If you have done a good job of declaring how you helped create the situation, you can likely simply reverse those steps. Either way, please write out a solution with actions, a DRI: Directly-Responsible Individual for each, and a due date.

Commit & Be Consistent
NOT micromanaging will be hard at first. Baby step it. Commit to doing better, share with your team what you intend to do, ask for accountability, and embrace the suck of not being great at something for a change. 

With time, you will feel the exhilaration that comes from great leadership — as well as the newfound mental and literal freedom you’ve created for yourself and your team.

Leadership requires a constant unfolding and letting go of prior phases and facets of our roles, especially for those of us who launched an idea into something big, moving through the ranks from founder or first employee to CEO.

Where are you getting in your own way? How are you blocking your team from growing and taking on more? If you're not sure, get quiet. Look within. Or better yet—ask your team. See what emerges. Then let's talk.

As companies grow, they hit known stages with associated known problems. Luckily, for each, there is also a known solution. Here are some of those stages, problems, and solutions.
There aren't many information-sharing or relationship-building problems when a company is small (<20 people) and in person. Everyone runs into everyone else, grocks the challenges the others face, and gains trust and familiarity with each other.
Once the company goes remote, or >20 people in person, then the story changes. Now, no one is casually running into each other. Get-to-know-you-as-a-human conversations (""Did you do anything fun this weekend?"") happen with some but not all people on the team. People no longer overhear everyone else's conversations (about company strategy, product direction, problems I'm encountering). Both of these information flows are critical. And now they must be intentionally created, or they won't happen. 
This is the first challenge. 
You must intentionally create a communication system that:
Informs the entire company of the current priorities of the company, decisions that have been made, and the direction of the product.
Informs the CEO and exec team of the problems being encountered by the team and gives them (the CEO and exec team) feedback on how they could perform better.
Creates human connection.
If you create this system effectively, it will likely take care of all future problems, as your team will inform you of both the problems and their solutions through Issues and Feedback.
But here are some to expect:
At about 50-150 employees, you will notice that compensation does not correlate to performance across the organization. The best performers don't necessarily make more. Those who advocate for themselves best do. You will want to end this practice. To do so, you will need to create a written description of levels of seniority and the compensation associated with them in a system known as Levels and Ladder, or Grade Level Planning. Then when people advocate for themselves, you can simply direct them to this written guidance. 
At >500 employees, your reviews on Glassdoor will suddenly start to go down. There will be some really nasty reviews for the first time, and people will say that you are evil. It will hurt. Until you realize that it has nothing to do with reality. It is simply that many employees feel that they don't have a personal connection to you. Because of that, whenever anything happens in the company that they don't like, they will not be able to attribute positive intent to you. Instead, they will attribute negative intent. Then, because of confirmation bias, they will soon see evidence everywhere of this negative intent. They will grow to hate you. But don't despair. This is easily counteracted by beginning a process of intentional connection to all employees. It's not exciting stuff, but it is easier to achieve than you think. How to maintain personal connection in a remote world
Also, in the 200-1,000 people range, you will be able to hire senior executives who each have their management system. If you allow each to implement their own, you will soon have a hodge-podge, and no one from one department will be able to know what people from another department are doing. This will lead to the assumption that the other department isn't doing anything at all. Acrimony will ensure. To counter this, simply create a unified management system that all have access to. And if you do this well, you won't need those senior execs in the first place. Hiring Execs: External vs. Internal (2 min)
At this stage, product and engineering output on new features/products slow to a snail's pace. You will wistfully remember your days as a 3-person YC startup and think, ""We produced a new product faster then."" And you won't be wrong. The reason is that with many users comes a lot of infrastructure and security, which is a massive overhead on pushing new code, whether a bug fix or a new product.

At that point, the biggest issue that you will have is that your exec team doesn't like or trust each other. This again is easily solved. You have to force them to get to know each other as humans. Trust: How to create it among peers (2 min)
There will also be constant pressure from your investors, employees, and even family members to go public. Just remember that it's a one-way door. Do a little bit of diligence before you walk through it. IPO, or not to IPO (3 min). I recommend giving everyone liquidity through secondaries instead: Liquidity Programs for the Company.

Example:  [PUBLIC] Mochary Method - Vision 2031
Mission
A mission should state the purpose of the company in one simple, short and memorable sentence. To do this, I like to answer the following question in as few words as possible:
Our purpose is to do what for whom?

Vision
A vision is simply a prediction of what the company will look like far on the horizon once it has achieved massive success. This can take many forms. But I like to keep it as short as possible (so that it is memorable) while also reinforcing key components. To me, those components are: 
Customer
Problem
Solution
Moat
Therefore, to create the ten-year vision, I imagine it is ten years from now. We are the dominant company in the industry. I ask myself:
What industry do we dominate?
Who is our customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
What pain do they have that we're solving for them?
What is unique about our solution that causes the customer to choose us over the competition?
What asset (human or physical) do we control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy our solution? In other words, what is our moat?

Values
There are many ways to create company values. Values should clearly define the behaviors that you want all team members to exhibit. Once created, you should hire for these behaviors and fire those unwilling to do these behaviors.
Here are two ways to determine what those behaviors are.
A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you …."" This is appropriate when the company is small, and values are entirely aspirational.

Another version is to acknowledge the culture that you already have. To do this, use a Brainstorming: written session to 
Ask each Leadership Team member to write down several examples of a person in the company who is NOT on the Leadership Team and exhibits a behavior that they wish would be a universal behavior. Name the person and the behavior. 
Of all the examples given, select 3-5.  
These are now your values (with real examples!). 
This method is best used when the company already has a sizable team and existing culture.","Create mission, vision, and values. Mission states purpose, vision predicts success, values define behaviors. Hire and fire based on values."

Mistakes happen. We all make them. But how do we make things right once we realize that we've made a mistake?
Three steps. Repair, Rewind, Redo.
Repair
The first thing to do is acknowledge: 
what I did
the damage that it caused
that I did not intend to cause that damage
make a commitment that I will not do that action again. 
""From now on in that situation, I will …""


Rewind
""Now, I'd like to go back in time and do it the way I plan on doing it from now on.”


Redo
Redo the statement or the action in the new way.


This process allows others to see that you recognize the damage you did, that you did not intend to cause that damage, and that you are able and willing to do it in a non-damaging way.

The Mochary Foundation seeks to create a legitimate first chance for all Americans.
While we Americans like to believe that our country is the land of opportunity and that anyone with the will can make it economically, the reality isn't quite so clean. Many forces make it difficult (sometimes nearly impossible) for someone to battle their way out of poverty. 
One of the harshest barriers is a criminal record. It costs $35 to do a background check online, and therefore nearly all employers do one. For most jobs, having a criminal background is an immediate disqualification. So, once a felon leaves prison or jail, she often cannot get a job. Yet, she must still eat. She, therefore, resorts to stealing or dealing. And the cycle of incarceration continues. 
But there is an answer. Jobs that require a hard skill or license and for which there is a shortage of qualified applicants are willing to ignore criminal backgrounds. These jobs include construction (skill) and truck driving (license).
We, therefore, created FreeWorld to help x-convicts get their Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and then a trucking job. The results have been dramatic.
In its first year, we trained 68 x-convicts (primarily in Stockton, CA) to get their license. All but one of those went on to earn a trucking job paying more than $40k/yr. Those who have entered their second year of driving are now making $60-80k/yr. And one that bought his truck is now making over $120k/yr.
It costs us about $5,000 to train each person (we call them Free Agents) to get their CDL. Once they are financially stable, we have begun asking each new Free Agent to pay back a portion of their income until they have paid for the cost of their training plus two more. The first of those payments should start arriving in 2020 and, if they continue, FreeWorld will quickly become self-funding.
In its second year, FreeWorld hopes to train 300 Free Agents and then, if all is continuing to function well, scale massively from there.","The Mochary Foundation helps ex-convicts get CDLs for trucking jobs, breaking the cycle of incarceration and poverty."

Magic Questions (1 min)

First, read Praise (3 min)
In addition to those techniques, I recommend coaching each team member to help them achieve an environment that allows them to feel joy and therefore produce their best work.
I ask my reports the following sets of questions once a month in our 1-1, where 1 is ""it couldn't be any worse,"" 5 is ""it couldn't be any better,"" and 3 is ""meeting expectation"":
How are you feeling about your life at work, 1-5?
What is your 5 year career vision?
Is what you are doing now at work leading you toward your 5 year career vision, 1-5?
How are you feeling about your personal life, 1-5?
How are you feeling about your Work From Home (WFH) setup, 1-5?
How are we performing as a company, 1-5?
What is it like to work with the rest of the team, 1-5?
What is it like to work with me, 1-5?


For the lowest category …
What would get it to the next level?


If unpacking personal life, please rate these categories, 1-5:
Relationship
Home
Career
Money
Time with friends and family
Fun and entertainment
Physical Health
Mind and Soul


For the lowest category …
What would get it to the next level?
I read through the entire list.  To improve Work Life, Personal Life, WFH and “Work with the rest of the team” usually require actions from the person.  So, from these categories, I pick the lowest rated one.  I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I help them formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level.  I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker.  (I usually don’t unpack a second category, unless it feels that the person has the capacity to handle more tasks.)
I then pick the lowest rated category among the remaining:  Company Performance and “Working with me”, as those usually require actions from me.   I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I ask them to help me formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level.  I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker.  

I ask these same questions (in writing) once per month for each team member.  Over time, each will rise until all are 4 or above.  And then magic usually happens.  
Even if I don't succeed in creating a perfect 5 environment, my team feels very heard and cared for, simply because I ask the questions and cause them to think about it.  In particular, the question about personal life (""How are you feeling about your life overall, 1-5?"") seems to unlock a lot of joy, which in turn boosts workplace productivity and loyalty. People feel honored that I care enough about them to help them tangibly improve their personal life.
For those team members who have high variability in motivation, I ask a further set of questions:
On your list of actions, what are you excited to work on?
On your list of actions, what are you not excited to work on?
For the actions that they are excited about, nothing needs to be done. They will crush those.
For each action that they are not excited about, I ask them which bucket it falls into:
Doesn't need to be done


Needs to be done, but someone else can do it. 


Who could do it?


Needs to be done, and only you can do it. 


What conditions would make it pleasant for you to do it? i.e., You would enjoy doing this action as long as … 


One trick that often works to make an unpleasant task less unpleasant is to do the task while co-working with someone else. So, I offer to have a co-working session with them. I work on the actions that I don't relish but am the only one who can do them. They work on their similar set. I find that we both get a lot done without feeling any pain. This is an Accountability Partner (1 min).
I have found that it only takes a few months for each team member to start answering 4/5 (most people hold back on giving a 5 because things could always be better, even if they don't know how) about their work life, their home life, how we are operating as a company, and my interaction with them. And when that happens, their productivity shoots through the roof. 
When I take the next step and make sure that each person works primarily on things that excite them, the fireworks begin.
Suddenly, a very small team can produce an immense amount of work. And the benefits of that … well, hopefully, you already know.  ","Matt shares techniques for motivating teams: Magic Questions, monthly 1-1s, personalized coaching, and focusing on joy and productivity."
Motivation beyond Mission and Money,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYtm81Ux3aI7bka0M49gx39obnW08pYgh7_EgRJ5q3w/edit ,"Motivation beyond Mission and Money

At a certain point in the company's financial success, your senior leadership team will have made serious money, and your company mission will have been largely accomplished. What then will keep your senior team motivated to continue in the trenches with you?
Well, ask yourself: What motivates you to keep going? 
There are only two basic sources of motivation in life: fear and joy. Fear is much more prevalent. It is what causes us to perceive scarcity of money, time, love, etc. At a certain amount of wealth, however, it becomes difficult to maintain this view of scarcity. Or, if someone starts to do personal consciousness work, then fear begins to melt away quickly. If joy is not present, the motivation to keep going in the job will also quickly disappear.
What is the answer?
Develop joy! It sounds trite. Discover that which brings each person joy, that which they would do for free. Eliminate all the activities that they suffer through. The easiest way to do this is to do an Energy Audit monthly until you fill the calendar with nothing but energy-creating activities. 
As proof of this, I can only offer myself as an example. I have made more money than I want to spend in my lifetime. I have also done enough consciousness work to lose my sense of scarcity. So fear no longer motivates me. I have done the Energy Audit repeatedly to the point that my calendar is almost entirely ""green."" This means that I do only two things:
On the weekends, I am with my family. 


During the week, I coach (which is essentially being a manager). 


I charged nothing for what I did for many years because I didn't want to lose the filter of only doing things that bring me joy. (Money might have confused that filter. At this point, though, there is no confusion.) 


And I do it from early morning to late at night, day after day after day. In fact, I can't get enough. I love it so much that I even bring it into my weekends and home by hosting meals at my house on weekends for my coachees. 
Are you bold enough to try this approach? First with yourself. And then, if it works for you, with your leadership team?

Navigating The Aftermath of Layoffs (By Sabrina Wang) (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/10TmIC8LWDVXjGtEYdhFxMavyYktR78P8Gaa8hcYeQzs/edit ,"Navigating The Aftermath of Layoffs (3 minutes)
By Sabrina Wang, CEO coach and Head of Coaching at Mochary Method
Watch at 2x: Sabrina going over the write-up in a Loom video
First, I want to acknowledge that layoffs are a difficult and challenging situation for any organization. This document will not be a complete set of answers. Rather, it’s a starting point to share some tried and tested tools from my CEO clients.
Layoffs can have a significant impact on the morale and motivation of employees who remain. As a CEO, your top concern may be maintaining the stability of your team and retaining your high performers. Here are a few steps you can take to help manage the situation and support your employees during this time of change.
Before you move on to the steps to navigate the aftermath, let’s review our Firing Well playbook and see if there are any tactics that you would like to implement before or during letting someone go. I interviewed Ophelia’s cofounder Mattan Griffel who shares his entire process and implementation around a layoff here.
Below, you can find the key recommendations for what happens after making a layoff decision.
Use an internal communication framework to announce the news
When it comes to announcing layoffs, it's crucial to have a clear and organized approach. Consider using Mochary Method’s guide to announce traumatic events. This will help you stay grounded and communicate the news effectively to your company. It is critical to have face-to-face 1-1 conversations with those who are let go and offer that face time to those who are staying to process their emotions.
One of our Mochary Method CEO coaches Faith Meyer wrote a write-up (You Lost Your Job. Now What?) that you can share directly or copy to send to your employees who are part of that layoff.
Conduct Magic Questions with your leadership team and managers
Magic Questions are a tool that can help you gauge the level of impact that layoffs are having on your employees. It’s key to ask questions and hold employees accountable for actions as you're going through Magic Questions. Check out instructions from Star performers:  How to keep them engaged and motivated.
Encourage your leadership team and managers to conduct Magic Questions with each of their direct reports, and consider conducting these surveys every 2-4 weeks for the next few months. This will create a space for employees to share their thoughts and feelings openly, helping to build trust and strengthen relationships.
Run an anonymous survey on motivation at work
If you want to get a deeper understanding of how layoffs are affecting employee motivation, consider conducting an anonymous survey. This can be especially effective if your company doesn't already have a culture of psychological safety, allowing employees to speak openly and honestly. If you do choose to run a survey, make sure to publicly share the top results and create a space for employees to ask questions and voice their concerns.
Ensure you’re personally supported 
Last but definitely not least, you and your executive team who are deeply involved in the layoff decision are going through an emotionally draining journey. These are hard decisions to make and trying conversations to have. It’s important that you are supported to process this news, so that you can be more available to your employees. I know of CEOs who commit to a more rigid personal routine during this time that includes but is not limited to cold plunges in the morning, daily fitness, meditation, therapy, coaching, time with family, and so on. If you need support during this time, please feel free to reach out to us at https://coach.mocharymethod.com/. We are here to help guide you to the right resources regardless of whether you become a coaching client or not.","CEO coach Sabrina Wang shares strategies for navigating the aftermath of layoffs, including communication frameworks, Magic Questions, surveys, and personal support."
No - how to say it (6 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ZlMMBfauLT-gbgKjzOvzZQEzQdrBP_qKkXV2dfEN50/edit ,"No - how to say it ,,. and do it (5 min)
When doing the Energy Audit, here are some of the most common things that CEOs do that don't give them energy:
Informational meetings
Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)
1-1s with former reports
Difficult conversations
1-1s that are not functional
Group meetings that are not functional
And here are some strategies to deal with them …

Informational meetings. 
Now that your company is succeeding, people want to talk to you. They ask to get a coffee together. If you don’t know the person asking, you have no obligation to respond.  But some of these people may be old friends, friends of friends, or significant people in the community. You don't get energy from spending an hour with them, but you also don't want to give them the cold shoulder and gain a reputation for being aloof.
Well, there is a solution. 
First, decide how much time you are willing to spend on the person.  
If it is 5 minutes or less, then …
Just as most 350-page business books only contain about three pages of real information, just so most times people want to get coffee for an hour, it is simply to ask for one favor, which takes 1 minute to ask, and likely two minutes to do. 
When someone emails me to get a coffee, I immediately call them. I know that they are free as they have just emailed me. They usually pick up. They are so honored that I called them quickly. I then let them know that I have just a few minutes, but I'd like to be helpful. They ask me the favor. (It is usually a request for an introduction.) I usually oblige, which takes me about two minutes. Done. The person feels honored that I responded so quickly and did what they were hoping for, and it took me less than five minutes total.
If I get the email long after they sent it, and they don't pick up when I call back, then I respond in an email: ""Scheduling a coffee will take a while, but I can call you fairly soon. You are now on my call list, and I will call you when I can."" I then put them on my call list and call whenever I would otherwise be listening to a podcast (i.e., in an Uber). This call usually occurs within 24-48 hours of their request. Again, they are honored by the speedy connection. And once again, the call need only last a few minutes.
If it is 1 minute or less, then …
I respond with a written email or text response.  Each time I encounter a new situation and therefore write a new response, I save it.  At this point, the vast majority of the time, I simply copy-paste a response that I have already written previously.  Here is an example:
“Thank you for your request to ….  While I am sure that I would enjoy that, I am choosing to focus my time on my top priorities, which are ____, ___, and ____.  And therefore I cannot accommodate your request.”
“While I cannot meet for coffee, I would like to help if I can.  What question do you have for me?  If I am able to help in a reasonable amount of, I will.”
If it is 30 seconds or less, then …
Get a CoS or virtual EA, and forward them each such request for the CoS/EA to create a draft message for you to send.   You then hit the Send button.

Podcasts
I am so honored by this request.  Thank you for thinking of me.  

That being said, I unfortunately don’t have space in my schedule to do it.   

I am focusing all of my podcast time on setting up and conducting the Mochary CEO Masterminds.   These give all Mochary Method CEOs access to the “behind the scenes” info that each of us can only get when the recording devices are turned off.

I love that you are doing your podcast.  It does and will create tremendous value.  I am cheering you on from the sideline!

While I can’t do your podcast, there is another Mochary Method coach who can.  Would you be open to having one of them on?  

Each of them has done at least one (and some several) excellent podcasts.  They are stars.  




Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)
Often a CEO likes to interview all candidates that are one level below her reports. And Recruiting wants to show at least 3-4 qualified candidates for each open position, which is more to prove that Recruiting is performing than it is about getting better candidates. Offer rates therefore are, by definition, around 25% or less. This strategy leads to many onsite interviews of candidates who never get hired—a tremendous cost. Don't pay it.
Instead, go with the policy of only bringing in an A player for an onsite interview (i.e., only candidates that absolutely blew you away in the first phone screen), and then be willing to hire that person without seeing any other candidates. If you do this, you will be able to move much faster. The best candidates can only be closed if you move very fast because they want to feel that you fell in love with them from the first moment that you met them. (Btw, someone else is moving very fast with them, so if you don't, you will lose them.) If you do this, your acceptance rate on the best candidates will go way up. And you will spend far less time interviewing, leaving far more time for onboarding your phenomenal hires and building the company.
Have your first phone screen scheduled for 15 minutes
In addition, once you make your initial phone screen very strict and only bring A players for onsite interview day, then do what Palantir does: They split the interview day into two halves and inform the candidate of this. They only pass to the second half of the day if the first half went well. At lunch, the team reads the morning interviewers' assessments. If they are positive, the candidate moves to the afternoon to meet the more senior interviewers. If the morning didn't go well enough, the interview day ends at lunch, thus saving a lot of time for the senior exec.
Some CEOs and Department Heads feel that they need to be the bar raiser. And the bar-raising function is indeed essential. But you don't have to be that person. You can train that person. The way to do that is:
They watch you do 2-3 interviews and see your conclusion.
You watch them do 1-2 interviews, and you give them feedback on their conclusion. Once you feel satisfied that the person will act as you do, then …
They take your place as a bar-raiser and teach someone else using the method above. 

1-1s with former reports
Many CEOs create deep relationships with their reports. As the company grows and they need to layer those reports, the layered person wants to maintain a connection with the CEO and asks to continue their 1-1s. The CEO often agrees. But later, these 1-1 with non-direct reports become burdensome as the opportunity cost of that time becomes higher and higher. 
Share this transparently with the non-direct reports. They are owners of the company too. They want to maximize their equity value. Once they realize that their 1-1s with you are taking you away from running the business, they will no longer want the 1-1s.

Difficult conversations
Many people fear difficult conversations. This emotion is understandable. We were never trained in school to have these conversations. We don't know how to make them go well. Read Feedback and practice (role-play) with a partner until you're able to stick to the script. Then try it on the next difficult conversation. You might end up loving difficult conversations!

1-1s that are not functional
They are your direct reports. You know that you need to have 1-1s with them. But the meetings are draining. What would make it exquisite for you? Write down all the criteria, and then share those criteria with your report at the next 1-1. Ask if they are open to having such a 1-1 going forward. They will say ""yes!""
If you're unsure what a fantastic 1-1 would look like, experiment with this 1-1 Template and Instructions.

Group meetings that are not functional
As the group leader, you have to hold group meetings to keep your team informed, decide on cross-functional issues, and facilitate feedback (peer-to-peer and to you). But that doesn't mean that you need to run the meeting. Pick your most process-oriented team member (or hire a Chief of Staff). Have them be the Meeting Lead. You are still the decision-maker, but they set the agenda, ensure that all attendees get their pre-work submitted before the meeting, keep the time-boxing during the meeting, ensure that issues drive to decisions and then to specific actions with DRIs and due dates, which all get recorded in your Agreements Tracker.

Much of what Reed Hastings writes in No Rules Rules matches my philosophy already
shared in Mochary Method Curriculum. But several things have pushed forward my thinking, which I will now shamelessly adopt.
Talent Density. 
This applies to creative roles, not operational roles …


Don't just let go of non-performers. Also, let go of adequate performers. Keep only great performers. Why? Because density of talent creates geometric gains in productivity. 

A smaller team of top performers will always outperform a larger team that includes adequate performers. 
Proof of this is seen 60 days after almost every layoff that has occurred in any company. 
It also opens up the budget to pay people at the top of the market, which you will need to attract and keep the very best.


Apply The Keeper Test: ""Which members of my team, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep?"" 


A keeper is someone who is both talented and collaborative. 
A talented jerk is not a keeper. 
Neither is a talentless sweetheart. 
Keep the keepers by paying them more than they could get anywhere else. 
Next, let the others go, with a very generous severance package, and actively help them find a great role at another company. 
Candor … with purpose. 
Of course, ask for feedback regularly and massively appreciate it when you receive it. Then ask your team members to do the same for each other. We all knew this already. Here's the new addition: 
When giving feedback, never do it as a way to vent your frustration (i.e., ""I feel anger, my thought is …""). Instead, always describe why the action you are suggesting will create value for the company and the person, not how it will create value for you by making you no longer feel anger.


Do live 360 feedback sessions at least once per year for each team member.

No decision-making controls
Each decision is made by the person who will implement it. The steps to do so are: 


If it's still an idea, write it up and ask plenty of team members for written advice.
If it's a decision, write it up and ask plenty of team members for written dissent.
If it's a big decision, find a way to test it before implementing it. 


If you want a fuller summary of the book, here it is ...

Talent Density: increase
A great workplace is stunning colleagues
Pay top of the market
The Keeper Test

Candor: increase 
Say what you really think (with positive intent)
Open the books
Circle of feedback

Controls: remove 
No vacation policy, nor travel and expense approvals
No decision-making approvals
Lead with context, not control
In his excellent book No Rules Rules, Reed Hastings explains the success of Netflix by stating that they have done three things differently than other companies:
They have created Talent Density. All companies let go of non-performers. But Netflix goes a giant step further. They let go of good performers as well. They strive only to keep great performers. Why? Because they believe that each human requires overhead (communication to create alignment, buy-in, motivation, accountability, etc.). All of this overhead creates drag on the company. Most people do not produce enough positive gain to overcome this overhead. Star performers freed of this overhead will create far more in a smaller team of only star performers than in a larger team filled with good performers.


They have Radical Candor. They say what they think, but with positive intent. This means that they share their views to help their colleagues and the company succeed, not vent their frustration. They also share the numbers transparently and give regular non-anonymized peer feedback. 


They have Removed Controls. Decision-making controls slow big companies and allows small startups to create new products far more quickly. Netflix has removed those decision-making controls. Individuals can make each decision they need to perform, as long as they solicit feedback from others before they decide.

These three things sound easy. But Reed warns that if you don't have them in your company now, don't jump straight to full implementation. The shock will be too much for your culture. Instead, move there in stages.

Stage 1
Talent Density. 
A star performer is someone who is both talented and collaborative. 
Highly talented jerks are actually toxic. So are non-talented sweethearts. 
Simply recognize that star performers want to be surrounded by other star performers. Performance -- both good and bad -- is infectious. 
Therefore seek to hire the highest-performing, most collaborative employees on the market. 


Radical Candor. 
Give and receive candid feedback often. Make it an agenda item in each meeting. At Netflix, you are disloyal to the company if you fail to speak up when you disagree with a colleague or have feedback that could be helpful. 
Start with feedback to the boss. Show your team that you view this feedback as critical to your success and the company's success. Treat it as a gift. Reward those who are willing to be most candid. 
Once you have modeled this behavior, your team will likely ask you to give them feedback.
Once you have modeled both receiving and giving feedback positively, you can then create an agenda item for peers to provide feedback to each other. 
When you do eventually give feedback, follow these guidelines, the 4 A's: 
Giving Feedback 
Assist. Give feedback with positive intent. Giving feedback to vent your frustration is not tolerated. Explain how a specific behavior change will help the person or the company, not how it will help you. 
Actionable. State what a person can do (positive action) to improve, rather than just telling them what they should stop doing. (Stopping to do something is not an action.)
Receiving Feedback 
Appreciate. Your brain (amygdala) will trick you and feel defensive. Know that this is coming, and don't give a defense or explanation. Instead, simply thank the person for being willing to share with you so candidly.
Accept (or not). You are required to listen to feedback and say ""thank you."" That is all. You only accept if it resonates with you. 


No jerks allowed. Some will give clear feedback but not follow the guidelines above. Instead, they will provide the feedback cuttingly. This step is toxic behavior and should not be tolerated, no matter how talented the feedback-giver is. Many star performers will leave when faced with this behavior, even if it's not directed at them. 


No gossip. Giving feedback means giving it straight to the person, not venting it to others behind their back. Only say about someone what you will say (or even better have said) to their face. If someone shares observations with you about someone else, simply ask them, ""What did that person say when you spoke to them about this directly?""


Removed Controls. 


Remove vacation policy. Allow team members to take the time they need to restore as long as they give notice, designate someone to cover their roles and responsibilities, and don't leave at a critical time. Model this behavior by taking restoration time yourself and announcing it to the company. The goal is overall increased productivity and contribution. 


Remove travel and expense controls. Simply ask people to spend company money as if it were your own, and act in the company's best interest. Give all employees context: ""Before you spend any money, imagine me asking you to stand up in front of me and explain why you chose to spend it that way. If you can comfortably explain, go ahead. If you can't, don't."" 
While some will cheat, the gains achieved by allowing them to move fast will outweigh the cheating. 

Stage 2
Talent Density. Pay top of the market. 


Do you want rock stars? Offer rock star pay. Don't let anyone ever leave because another company was willing to pay more. In the end, you'll have to pay this amount anyway to recruit a new person, so why not stay ahead of it? Always know the current market and pay new and existing team members top of the market. 
Encourage team members to take recruiter calls and ask, ""How much does it pay?"" This action is the easiest way to know what the market is.


In creative roles (like engineering), the most talented create 100x more value (not 10x) than the average person. Therefore don't mess with pay. Simply pay top of the market (just beyond what any other company will). 
Create enough budget for this by letting go of all but your best people. 


No bonuses. They stifle creativity. 


Radical Candor. Open the books. 


Share all information you see (financials, operating reports, security breach debriefs, strategy documents) with the company. 
Train every team member to read financial statements so that they understand what they are seeing.
Even share the things that you wouldn't want competitors to see (strategy documents). Your team will reward you by acting with greater understanding, and therefore greater effectiveness. 
If someone abuses your trust, deal with that person individually, and continue to share openly with everyone. Don't punish the majority for the behavior of the few.


If you have already shown yourself to be competent, then when you do make a mistake, widely advertise it and the lessons you've learned. This will build even further trust. And will role-model it to the team.


When you let someone go, explain the reasons clearly to the rest of the team. This will end the gossip and theorizing. 


Removed Controls. No decision-making approvals are needed. Instead, it is Individual decision-making with input. 


Encourage your team members to experiment by making bets. They will be judged by the overall outcome of their portfolio of bets, not any single bet. 
Before they make a bet, ask them to follow the decision-making checklist.


Decision-making checklist 


Farm for dissent, or socialize the idea. 
Farm for dissent: For a decision that you are about to make, write it up. Share it with team members asking them to rate -10 to +10, explaining their rating.
Socialize: For an idea that isn't yet fully baked, write it up. Ask team members to give their advice.


For a big idea, test it out.


You are the Informed Captain. You make the bet. 
Every decision has a clear and stated Informed Captain. That person has complete decision-making freedom. 
For example, whoever has to live and breathe the contract should be the one to sign the contract. If you're the Informed Captain, you sign the contract. 
This optimizes for speed and learning, not getting it perfect the first time. That is what you want.


If it succeeds, celebrate. If it fails, ""sunshine"" it by sharing exactly how and why it didn't work with the company. 
To encourage a team member to sunshine a failure: 
Ask what learning came from the project?
Don't make a big deal out of it.
Ask her to ""sunshine"" by sharing the results and learnings with the company.
Let your team know that mistakes will be forgiven if they lean into sunshining (the first few times). If they try to deny the mistake, there will be no next time. 

Stage 3
Talent Density. 


Now it's time to let go of all but the best performers. You've been giving clear feedback, so there should be no surprises.


Think of this as a professional sports team, not a family. Everyone knows that to win a championship, you need the best players on the field. 


Use The Keeper Test to determine who to keep. 
""Which members of my team, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep?"" 


Adequate performance gets a generous severance. 
PIPs rarely help a team member improve (especially if you have already been giving regular and clear feedback), and they delay the firing by many weeks.
To receive the severance, the employee must agree not to sue the company.


This is not stack-ranking and forced dismissals of the bottom X %. That fosters internal competition, which is toxic. The Keeper Test, by contrast, achieves both talent density and strong collaboration. 


If any team member is feeling anxious, encourage them to ask you the Keeper Question. 
""If I were thinking of leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind?""


To abate fear of job loss for the team, do a ""post-exit Q&A"" after each member's departure so that each remaining team member can understand why the person was asked to leave and confirm that the person got plenty of feedback beforehand. Shine a bright light on it. It is the best way to wash away people's fear for their position.


Radical Candor. 
No gossip allowed. ""Only say about someone what you will say to their face.""


Collect regular 360 feedback on every person in the company to help each person get better (Don't tie this feedback to raises, promotions, or firings). 
Each author is named. 
Schedule time for the recipient to talk to each author and more fully understand the feedback. 
Encourage every recipient to make their feedback public to the company.


Conduct live 360s. These are the most valuable. 
Length and location: 
Keep the group small (8 or less)
Do it over a meal
Plan on 20 minutes per person
Method: 
Phrase all feedback as actions.
Start with the positives. This should be about 25% of the time allotted. ""Please continue to ….""
The rest should be 
""Please stop doing …"", or
""Please start doing ….""
The team leader receives first.


Removed Controls. Lead with context, not controls 


If your goal is innovation, then context is best. 
If your goal is error prevention (i.e., preventing workplace deaths), then controls are best.


Talent density must first be high.


Create a loosely-coupled system, i.e., each function has little dependency on another function. As Amazon does it, this can be achieved with a small team that has all the functions on that team that it needs to create and launch a product. 
Create alignment throughout the team on what the North Star is. 
Write out your vision for where the company is headed (i.e., where it will be in 10 years, one year, three months) and how it will likely get there.
Share this with all in many different ways (writing, video, audio) and locations (1-1s, team meetings, messages).
Do many skip-level meetings to ensure that all are aware of the necessary context.
When a team member doesn't perform, first ask, ""What context did I fail to set?""
Once you have set the context, release controls. Common controls that most companies have but Netflix doesn't are: 
Vacation policies
Decision-making approvals
Expense policies
PIPs (Performance Improvement Plans)
Approval processes
Raise pools
Key Performance Indicators
Management by objectives
Travel policies
Decision-making by committee
Contract sign-offs
Salary bands
Pay grades
Pay-per-performance bonuses 
These things squash innovation, slow the business, or prevent the organization from changing quickly when the environment shifts.","Netflix's ""No Rules Rules"" emphasizes talent density, radical candor, and removing controls for innovation and success in the workplace."
OKR Creation (6 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoiH4pwsph5rwSM_wMMiMJkX6-qFVwO0SVYkodNZhwg/edit ,"OKRs (6 min)
For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3. Three Objectives, with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs). 
(Warning: A common mistake is to create Department OKRs, without creating Company-level OKRs. This omission leads to silo-ed fiefdoms that do not work together nor trust each other.)
The Objective (O) answers the question: ""Where do we want to go?"". This objective should tell a compelling story akin to the tagline of a Hollywood movie. It does not need to be measurable (i.e., ironically, it can be subjective). But it should be inspiring.
Key Results (KRs) answer the question: ""How do we know that we're getting there?"" KRs should be objectively measurable. 
Here are examples:
Objective: Massively grow revenues.
Key Results- 
$500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) [metric that lets us know we've gotten to the desired result]
Hire ten additional SDRs. [step needed to get to the result]
Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team. [action required to get to the result]
Company OKRs should be broad enough to encompass the whole company so that each department and team can feel that their work contributes to at least one of its priorities. Typical company-level OKRs include:
Profits: Massively grow revenues while minimizing expense
Product: Delight our customers
People: Create a positive and transparent environment where we are all inspired to do our best work
Forming OKRs
At the end of every quarter, gather the leadership team and collaborate on the coming quarter's OKRs. I've found the process that gets the best results, and most buy-in is to ask every member of your leadership team to separately write up what they think the global OKRs of the company should be. Then combine the ideas of everyone into one document. You will see common themes and have a healthy debate about the company's priorities. But in the end, you are the Decision-Maker, and you must choose what the company's OKRs are. This is not an exercise in consensus, just in hearing people out.
The critical thing to keep in mind when forming OKRs is that they are clearly defined and measurable so a third party can adjudicate whether or not they were completed. 
Once your leadership team has come up with the company's OKRs, share them with the broader team and instruct each department head to perform the same process within their department and then at the individual level during one-on-ones. 
Keep in mind that each person should develop their OKRs (that align with the company's) rather than you dictating each person's OKRs. That way, each person feels personally invested in their OKRs and has 'buy-in.'
The OKR creation process is usually a distracting one. Therefore, keep it to one week or less if at all possible. Make this an Admin Week, and do all the other required quarterly admin processes (last quarter's OKR de-brief, performance management, etc.) during that same week.
Here is a potential timeline for OKR creation during Admin Week:
Timeline
Monday. 
Leadership Team meeting (with all Department Heads). 2 hours to create company OKRs using Structured brainstorming. 
Tuesday. 
Each department has a group meeting (2 hours) to create department OKRs. CEO to check and approve all department OKRs by the end of the day.
Wednesday. 
Each team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create team OKRs. Department head to check and approve all team OKRs by the end of the day.
Thursday. 
Each sub-team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create sub-team OKRs. The team head to check and approve all sub-team OKRs by the end of the day.
Friday. 
Each individual creates individual OKRs. Sub-team head to review and approve all individual OKRs by the end of the day.
Monday. 
At the Leadership Team meeting, the CEO checks and approves all OKRs. Announce all OKRs to the company at All Hands.
Tracking OKRs
Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Google Sheet or Notion page. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an example.
Prompt the leadership team to update the status of their OKRs (on-track, lagging, poor) as part of the one-on-one process, and ask your managers to do likewise.
All OKRs that are far off-track require that the DRI (directly responsible individual) create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.

The above method works well for a company of fewer than 100 people. If you are over 100, you will have to tweak the process a bit.
This is how Pinterest does it: Pinterest's Pyramid OKRs. ","OKRs: Objectives and Key Results. Set 3 objectives with 3 key results each. Create for company, departments, teams, individuals. Track progress."

Video of Matt explaining On Time (2 min)
It is critical to be on time for every appointment you have made or let the others involved in the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize it. This action is common decency, yes, but it has greater significance. 
There is a person on the other side of your agreement to start the meeting at a specific time. They have stopped what they are working on to attend the meeting on time. If you do not show up on time, they cannot start the meeting, but they also cannot leave because they don't know if you'll show up the next minute or not. 
Each minute they are away from their work is a minute of productivity you have stolen from them. This action is not only disrespectful but also counterproductive. If the attendee is a customer, investor, or recruit, they will not engage with your company. If they report to you, they will keep quiet but resent you. There is no winning scenario when you waste someone's time.
But life happens. Calls and meetings run late, or traffic doesn't cooperate. Even with careful planning, it's not possible to be on time for every meeting. The good news is that you don't need to be. 
It is only critical to let the other members of the meeting know that you will be late as soon as you realize that you will be. And you must come to this realization (and let the other attendees know) before the meeting starts, through whatever channel will get to them the fastest. Ideally, you'd let them know about the delay before they must break away from whatever they are doing before the meeting.
In addition to being on time, you must also be present. Being present means that you are composed, prepared, and focused on the subject matter. It can take a few minutes to ""get present"" -- prepare the agenda, research the topic and the attendees, etc. 
 Therefore, I recommend that you plan to arrive at an outside meeting fifteen minutes before it is to begin. For a meeting in your office, wrap up your current project five minutes before the scheduled meeting time. 
To make this easy, I recommend scheduling 25 and 50-minute meetings only (Google Calendar even has an automated setting for this). This buffer will give you five minutes each half-hour and ten minutes each hour to gather yourself.
When in the meeting, I often see CEOs making the mistake of constantly checking their messages. They cannot get away from being ""on,"" if even for a second. This habit is disrespectful, but it also defeats the purpose of the meeting, which is a collaboration with the attendees present. It sends a message that the meeting's content is relatively unimportant. Furthermore, it also breeds a bad habit for the entire company—one that will be hard, if not impossible, to break down the line. 
During every meeting, leave your phone in your pocket or face-down. Staying committed to Inbox Zero will help you focus on your meetings and make the most out of your assembled—and valuable—talent. 
And if the meeting is not efficient, then make it so.
","Being punctual and present in meetings is crucial for respect and productivity. Notify if late, be focused, limit distractions, and be efficient."
Onboarding a new hire (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwrvtGTdhCbxparQ3a4y7Z5RidSHXzsZORoGTubcY3U/edit ,"Onboarding a new hire (3 min)

Video of Matt talking to Ryan Caldbeck (senior exec) about his reaction to shadowing (2 min)

Every position you hire for is already being done by someone in the company right now. The current work will be stretching someone doing it, they may not be performing as well as you want them to, but they are doing it.

Any new hire does not know your company, how you do things or the team dynamics. If you ask the new hire to start the position on Day 1 without context, there is a high probability that they will fail.

Fear not; there is an easy solution.  

For the first 30 days (even better is 60), ask them to shadow the person who is currently doing the job (observing all 1-1s, team meetings, and external meetings). 

After 30 days (or 60), the new hire can then take over. They will now have the full context of what you were doing before and will retain valuable history. They will have strong opinions about improving things, but they will also know what valuable pieces to preserve. They are now highly likely to succeed. 

When they do take over, it is critical that you also shadow them for 2-4 weeks (or as long as you can stand it, because frankly this reverse shadowing will likely be quite boring and painful for you), and give them feedback after each meeting until you realize that they are performing better in the role than you were!!

When reverse-shadowing, it  is key to withhold your feedback until after the meeting so that you don’t interrupt the new hire’s flow.  If you have the discipline to watch a recorded meeting, then an easy way to ensure that you only give feedback after the meeting is to video record the meeting, watch the recording (at 1.5x speed), and then give feedback.  Personally, I do not have this discipline, so I therefore observe the live meeting and simply write down my feedback and share it immediately afterwards.

This technique can be generalized for all Teaching / Training.


Another way of saying this same thing…
To learn about the onboarding process from a Chief of Staff’s point of view, please read: Onboard yourself in 30 days, by Regina Gerbeaux

Everyone I coach, I recommend getting a Chief of Staff (2 min), and almost all have. These Chiefs of Staff are usually young (<30) and therefore relatively inexperienced. They gain the trust of the CEO, perform well, and most end up running entire departments within the company. The success rate among them is close to 100%. 

My coachees also hire new executives. These folks are usually much more experienced, and on paper, much more impressive. Logic dictates that their success rate should be higher than those of the CoS role. Instead, their success rate is about 50%. 

Why is this? I have concluded that it is all about onboarding. We allow the CoS to shadow the CEO for months (gaining full context) before asking them to perform. On the other hand, the executives are usually air-dropped into a live fire (without context) and asked to perform Day 1. 

I ask my CEOs, “If you could wait 30-60 days and bring your new executive success rate from 50% to 100%, would you?” They, of course, all answer, “Yes.” So, we are now implementing the above onboarding methodology.  

This just started in April of 2021. I will update you on the results over the coming months and years. I am enormously optimistic.  

It is November 2021.  The results are starting to come in.  They are all excellent.  BioRender, Vendr, Viz, Belong, Sonder, Vendr have all done this with great success.  More coming soon.  





Feedback

From Regina Gerbeaux, my former Chief of Staff:

Shadowing somewhat resonates with me as someone who went through this process with Matt. I think it was tremendously helpful to onboard by shadowing Matt’s every move. (Things rarely set in for me when I passively observe.) For someone like me, though, I know I learn better by doing versus watching.

Therefore, I think this format (observing for 30-60-90 days) works very specific to how a company functions, but less so for mundane tasks like ordering things, scheduling internal meetings, etc., where the stakes are less high (aka Type 2 tasks or decisions.) I feel most free and like I learned the most when performing the task versus watching, especially when I already know how to do it.

TL;DR:
Shadow for 30 days? YES.  
Observe company-specific things to gain context? YES.  
Observe even mundane, small tasks? NO. Do those myself instead.

From Trishia Pasaquian, my EA:

Yes, it resonates with me. Based on my experience as a new hire, shadowing is the most effective way to learn and gain context of what the company is about, what they do, and how they do it. I’m not sure about the 60 days, but 30 is good. After 30 days, Loom recordings, Notion write-ups, or Tango will do, primarily if some tasks can be taught/discussed during coworking times.

From Sydney Liu, CEO of Commaful:


When we were hiring for our Chief of Staff role, we did paid shadowing as the final step. The final candidates shadowed me for a day and shared their notes about what they observed, learned, found exciting, and what could be improved.


This was a great way to get a feel for what it was like to work with the person while also seeing what they absorbed, how they processed information, what they could do on the job, and how organized they were all in several action-packed hours. We were able to make an informed hire for this role based on this portion of the interview.

Optimizing Post Mortems (2 min) by Faith Meyer,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fypz_DPsBiQADTJof0XSJwLNIdU5-Lr-JxPwPQV4WZA/edit?usp=sharing ,"Optimizing Post Mortem& Retros (2 min) by Faith Meyer

Post mortems can be one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to boost morale, and accelerate your teams’ performance and growth through clear communication and transparency. 

If you’ve never run one before, a post mortem is designed to assess what went well and what went wrong as a group to capture key learnings/insights to “know better, do better” and set the whole team up for enhanced success going forward. 

Post mortems are generally done upon project completion, but for projects with long timelines, I’d strongly recommend that you do not wait for the project to finish — communicate early and often with the team and learn and improve as you go.

Here are some time-tested tips for how to run the most effective post mortems.

All key parties should do the pre-work.
Meetings are expensive. Get right to the point by mandating that your team do the pre-thinking ahead of time.
I’m a fan of giving my team pre-set questions to answer prior to the group meeting. I personally would use a Google Doc to collate answers. Others have used questionnaires, Notion… choose whatever method has the lowest friction — i.e. use whatever platform your team is most comfortable with.


Hold the space for both the negatives and positives.
The words “post mortem” often have a slightly negative connotation, and the biggest mistake I see teams make is focusing only on what went wrong and not checking in on what’s working well. 
In the pre-work and/or the meeting, ask your team to consider what went/is going really well? What’s working from what you all set out to do?


Let the pre-work inform the agenda and assign a DRI for keeping the meeting on track.
Once you’ve received everyone’s pre-written answers/input, take time to read through them and suss out key themes to cover in the meeting. Use whatever emerges to influence the agenda for the session. 
General best agenda practices include the four Rs:
Revisit the initial goals of the project, the metrics, and the “why” behind the project.
Review the results.
Reassess. This is the bulk of the meeting. What worked? What didn’t? How are people feeling? What have we learned?
Regroup. Make a clear plan going forward based on the key learnings.
The DRI should time box the conversation and bring the group back to the key points if and when the conversation digresses.


Assign a DRI for maintaining documentation and tracking outcomes.
Make certain that one person is responsible for capturing key takeaways, next steps and insights from the meeting.


Set clear actions and accountability for key learnings and share them out to the team.
At the end of the session, do a repeat back out loud of what each person’s next steps are, what precisely they intend to do, and when exactly they’ll take those next steps by.
The DRI should capture these key actions and dates, as well as other high level key learnings that need to be preserved and revisited going forward.
Share out these learnings and takeaways with the collective team and hold each other accountable to any shared agreements made during the post mortem review!

Parenting as a CEO (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BfBM6VrKzYz1snAzVFhA6ebxPGR4XYc03kfKf1qSBI/edit ,"Parenting as a CEO (2 min)

The CEO role (2 min)	is full-time if you do every piece of it.  Luckily, you don’t have to.  You can delegate all the functions that don’t energize you.

Similarly, being a parent is full-time if you do every piece of it.   Luckily, you don’t have to.  You can delegate all parts of it that don’t energize you.

Unfortunately, you don’t yet know what the parenting role is exactly, so you don’t know which pieces do and don’t energize you.  Therefore, hire a team of people to do all parts of the parenting role.  That way, when you discover which parts energize you, you can keep doing them.  And when you discover which ones don’t, there is someone there to take those over immediately.   

If you have not hired such a team, then you will be stuck doing the de-energizing parenting tasks, while also recruiting your team, which will take 3-6 months.That will be a very painful 6 months.  And your company will suffer during this time, because you will underperform as a CEO.  

Don’t do that.  Instead, over-hire. 

I recommend that you hire:
1 full-time night nurse
1 full-time nanny (daytime)
1 weekend nanny to give time off to the FT night nurse and nanny
1 full-time personal Chief of Staff

Family members can play any one of those roles, as long as they actually are willing to live with you and put in the hours.  Please pay them whatever you would pay a non-family member.

As in hiring for any role, hire for excellence. And be willing to pay for it.  Market in the US for a top-tier night nurse is over $200,000/yr in 2021.   Be willing to pay it.

In fact, the company should pay these salaries.  This team will allow you to fully perform as a CEO.  There are, therefore, likely no higher-leverage employees at the company.  

As you read this, you are likely thinking “This is so exaggerated. Billions of people are parents, and perform just fine in their jobs. I can too.  I don’t need this insane human infrastructure that Matt is describing.  I want to actually enjoy my children and look forward to spending time with them.”

So be it.  But billions of people are not trying to be CEOs of fast-growing multi-billion dollar companies.  If you are, please don’t copy the behaviors of those who aren’t.  


From Virgilio Bento at Sword Health: 
I absolutely agree with it and learned that the hard way. It absolutely takes a village, so get a village :)","Delegate parenting tasks to a hired team, including a night nurse, nanny, and chief of staff, to excel as a CEO."

Politics (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cINzNPcmFPrK8wLQ6L693UDRaioVsZxdaK5XPNkIMew/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Politics (2 min)
In this context, ""politics"" means lobbying to gain personal benefit. Politics are poison for a company. They direct energy away from customer problem-solving, and once they take hold, the result is a quick race to the bottom.
Politics are created when someone successfully lobbies the CEO or their manager for some benefit. Others see this, so they, in turn, lobby. They then gain a benefit, and the virus spreads quickly throughout the organization.
It often begins very innocently: ""Excuse me, can I please talk to you about a raise? I have been at this company for a year now and have shown utter dedication by doing such-and-such, and I believe that I now deserve a raise…""
This sounds compelling, and you, of course, want to reward dedication. But if you give a raise based on this conversation, the whole company will learn that the way to get a raise is simply to ask you for it. 
Suddenly everyone will be trying to curry your favor. Be very careful here. You may enjoy this behavior, but it is toxic for the company.
The only way to prevent politics is never to allow lobbying to be successful. The only way to do this is to have a written policy about as many situations as possible, particularly around compensation and titles (raises and promotions). Apply this policy to all team members, all the time.
It isn't easy to create objective criteria for raises and promotions, but there are models. The most successful method I know of is called Grade Level Planning—at least, that's what Tesla calls it. It calls for a very detailed definition of every position in the company, and every seniority level, along with specific compensation metrics for each position and level. This is then shared throughout the company. Team members can then clearly see what they need to do to receive the next compensation and title level. Managers must not deviate from this written schema.
When a company is smaller (fewer than fifty employees or so) and growing fast, there is often so much fluidity that it can be challenging to implement Grade Level Planning (GLP). Most companies end up doing GLP at 150+ employees, but that is often too late. The compromise is somewhere in the middle. I recommend starting to think about GLP at twenty-five to fifty employees and then implementing as soon as is practical after that.","Politics in a company are toxic, distracting from problem-solving. Prevent lobbying success with clear policies and compensation criteria like Grade Level Planning."
Possibility Mindset (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0PS8RwdbLGvSbmUCTX1y66Dy5xsInjqv1vad1EWCR0/edit?usp=sharing ,"Possibility Mindset (3 minutes)
by Sabrina Wang (@sabrinawangzq)

We know that fear and anger give bad advice, and can directly influence the quality of your thinking. You can lash out to an employee or undersell during a fundraising pitch. Once you shift out of fear and anger, you can make better business decisions from a neutral mindset.

I believe there to be an even better way to make decisions. You do this by intentionally imagining all the possibilities for yourself and your company. You will feel the excitement, inspiration, and hope. Therefore, you will decide on the CEO you want to become, not just the CEO you are today. I call this the possibility mindset.

Let’s see the different mindsets in CEOs I coached:
Fear-based mindset
Fear-based mindset is when we allow our amygdala to cause us to make decisions while we are still in fear.
For example, if a CEO feels threatened by competition, she may allow her fear to cause her to create a product strategy that matches her competition's feature sets, rather than concentrating on what is actually solving her customer's problems.
Neutral mindset
You have a neutral mindset when you’re no longer in fear. You can analyze the current state objectively and logically.
For example, once the CEO shifts away from fears, she can see that it’s more advantageous to play offense in her product strategy by investing in their existing features.
Possibility mindset
Possibility mindset is when you are guided by rich details of your biggest dreams. You can see where you want to go and how to get there clearly.
I once coached a CEO by building her 3-year vision in detail. When she felt that excitement, I asked her about her product strategy. It dawned on her that she's always been a category innovator. She decided to spin up engineers to develop new technology and break waves.

When used in balance, a possibility mindset can create bolder and more efficient decisions.

Here are a few ways to get into possibility mindset (or coach your direct reports to get there):
Document 3-year vision by dreaming as big as possible (30 minutes)
3-year is long enough to be ambitious, and short enough that you can get very specific. A dream that is well-balanced in ambition and realisticness creates a high level of motivation. When you do this exercise, you will likely feel inspired. You’ll get into a possibility mindset for all areas of your life. 
Take out your note-taking tool and start describing what your 3-year biggest dream looks like in personal life, work-life, friends, physical home, health, money, fun/recreational, and religious/spiritual life. Please write in the present tense. You can repeat this every quarter.
Imagine your future self (3 minutes)
Imagination is a powerful tool. Athletes practice visualizing the finish line over and over again. In this context, you can imagine who you are when you’ve achieved your goals. That will often unlock wisdom and knowledge you already have, but you are not listening to yet. It puts you in possibility by thinking about the more mature, confident, and experienced version of you. 
Imagine yourself when you achieved your goals. Where are you? What are you wearing? What's your facial expression? What do you feel like? With your eyes still closed, ask yourself what you'd do in this situation. You can take these questions with your eyes closed, or journal back and forth to your future self.
Energy Audit (3 minutes to read, 45 minutes to do)
Make Energy Audit a regular part of your life; I recommend once every quarter. This will help you feel more joy towards your work, therefore more likely to imagine possibilities. 
Weekly reflection (10 minutes)
Cause your CoS or EA to sit with you and do a weekly reflection of what’s going on with your company. You can look at actions, OKRs, challenges, and wins. Please make sure you take time to document, verbalize, and celebrate each win. Then, you'll feel hopeful and confident in yourself. You’ll begin to see the possibilities.
Practicing gratitude
We perform our best when we are in joy and gratitude for our present moment. You can turn gratitude into a daily practice through meditating, journaling, or a general attitude.

Now that you have some instructions on moving into a possibility mindset, choose 1-2 to commit to. Take out your calendar or task management tool to schedule them in. 

Possibility mindset can be practiced, refined, and mastered. It’s like going to the gym. The more you go, the better effects you’ll see. There’s tremendous power in believing in new possibilities. Dreaming is the first step to making it real.
","Shift from fear and anger to a ""possibility mindset"" for better decision-making. Tips include envisioning goals and practicing gratitude regularly."
Praise (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFhFbtIxmUdrUe9y341ghd-EJ89hJZ7g9tOKnw16FI/edit ,"Praise (3 min)
Motivation is a tricky thing. If you're a CEO or Manager, how do you create it in your team members? How do you maintain it?
Luckily, most people arrive in a job or a relationship with lots of motivation. So, your only job is to help them maintain it. 
Jordan Petersen observes that if someone does something willfully or intentionally to break the rules or not meet the standards of performance, and you call them out on it, they almost feel relief. They know that they didn't perform, and it's almost comforting to know that you noticed. You haven't hurt the person. 
By contrast, if you want to hurt somebody, find someone earnestly trying and chastise them for something they didn't do as you wanted. You will crush them. 
Now, of course, none of us wants to hurt anybody nor crush their motivation. The key then is to realize that nearly EVERYONE around us is trying. Our team members, our spouse, our kids, our parents, and our siblings. Nearly EVERYONE.
Treat them as such. 
Right now, you are likely thinking: ""So, how do I get them to do what I want if I can't point out what they're doing wrong?"" 
Do the inverse. Point out what they are doing right!!! Thank them for it. ""Thank you for doing …."" Describe a specific action that they did, not a general personality trait. 
Good: 
""Thank you for sending out all the board materials one week before the board meeting."" 
""Thank you for doing the dishes last night.""
Not good: 
""Thank you for being so conscientious."" 
""Thank you for being so helpful.""
It may seem simple. But it's potent.
Every time you notice them doing something right, point it out. They will glow with satisfaction that you noticed what they did and that they are trying. Then they will be eager to do even more that is positive. They may even ask you what else they can do. But even if they don't, they will continue to do that one thing that you praised.
As time goes on, notice and praise other things. You are giving them confidence and motivation. Very quickly, you will see their overall performance improve.
And note that these praisings do not have to be lengthy nor in person. You can send a text. It often takes less than one minute to write. You can even make this a regular habit: once a week, or even once a day. 
At some point, maybe after 4-8 interactions of praise, they will build a sense of trust that you genuinely appreciate them and want to be in a lasting relationship with them. Once that happens, you have the leeway to point out things that you wish they would do differently (which is best done synchronously, not via text). But never forget to continue to praise as well. 
I encourage you to experiment with this at home first. Try it with a child or spouse. I predict that you will experience magic.   
","Praise is key to maintaining motivation. Acknowledge and thank individuals for specific actions, fostering a positive environment and boosting performance."
Product:  Innovating (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBQxgfcN1ySKcuw5MW6BFIRT4JMIP64ykRgETyJepa4/edit ,"Product:  Innovating (3 min) 
by Matt Mochary


Beyond Bill Aulet, author of Disciplined Entrepreneurship, there are 3 voices that have massively impacted how I think about Product Development.  


Marty Cagan, author of Inspired
Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman
Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health


Traditional product development


Marty Cagan is the current guru of product development.  He writes that the old way of doing product development is:
Talk to a bunch of new or potential customers. 
Understand the top problems they have and identify the commonalities among them. 
For the top common problem that has the least good solution currently in the marketplace, figure out how you can solve it far better than the current next-best solution.
List the features required, prioritize those features by building the easiest ones with the most impact first, and the hardest ones with the least impact last.  This is your Product Roadmap.  Go build.


The new way, he writes, is:
Still talk to new or potential customers, and figure out the top common problem that has the least good solution currently in the marketplace.  Then …
Build a prototype of your solution and get it into real users hands in a matter of days. 
Don’t waste time designing the solution.  Instead, slap together a quick and dirty prototype and get it in the hands of users for their reactions.  
User feedback is far more valuable than design. So, skip design and get to user feedback as fast as you can.
And then create another prototype and get into real users hands in another few days.
Keep iterating like this until users are loving the prototype.  Then build that!


Superhuman innovation


Superhuman went through this process and got real users. Some loved his early prototype, others thought it was OK.  


Rahul Vohra, CEO, interviewed all of their users and found that Superhuman was solving different problems for different users. Better solutions were available for the people who didn't love the product. However, the people who loved Superhuman had a problem for which Superhuman was the only solution. 


So which feedback should he listen to when creating the next version? Rahul’s first instinct was to win over those who didn’t yet love the prototype, since their feedback was harsher.  But then it dawned on him … 


“Rather than try to dumb this product down into something that's generic like everything else, why don't I just focus on the people who have a problem that only I can solve and then go find many more people with that same problem?” 


And that’s exactly what he did.  He documented his thinking in this article.


That's the first innovation: Talk to your users to figure out all the problems your users have, but really focus on solving the problem for which there is no other good solution.  Focus on your users who couldn’t make it without your product.  


Prototyping


Prototyping tools have become extraordinarily good.  Figma, many different no code tools, prototyping in custom code (as long as there is a sandbox where the code doesn’t need to be stable) are all excellent options.  The key is to create a prototyping space that isn’t connected to your production site, so that the team building your main product doesn’t require the code to be stable before releasing it to the world.  Only then will you be able to build prototypes as fast as they want to be built.


“Well, how separate is separate enough for the prototyping space?”


Driving innovation via separate incorporated entities

Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health, has pushed the separation more than anyone else I know when developing a new product in a scaled company. She feels that having a beta site that is not gated, that is not beholden to production, is not separate enough. For features for an existing product, that may work. 


But when she’s building an entirely new product, she wants a separate reporting line for the new product team.  She doesn’t want them to report to the VP Eng or VP Product for the primary product.  Why?  Because there is overhead in being part of a large team:  
The time and headspace it takes to participate in meetings with the manager and the rest of the larger team.
The design influence of the existing product designer.
The need for code to be stable and secure before being released to existing customers.


All of these things slow down speed to prototype.  And Wei doesn’t want to burden her new product teams with any of it.  So, for any new product team, she …


Creates a new product team that reports directly to her.
Creates a new corporate entity (which is easy to do), that is 100% owned by Clipboard Health, that owns and operates that new product team.
The separate company doesn't really add anything functional but it adds great symbolism in that it proves to the team that they really are not beholden to anyone in the existing infrastructure, in the existing tool, in the existing company.
The team feels like they're a true YC start-up with three to five members per team, someone who's designated as the CEO, and they have their own entity (bank account, etc).
Creates a second new product team that is trying to solve the same problem, to maximize the amount of innovative problem-solving.
Microsoft did the same thing, and quickly realized that if one team “won” and created the product that was eventually used, and the other team was not rewarded, then people became reluctant to join any future product team for fear of being on the losing team.  (It turns out fear of losing is stronger than joy from winning.)
So MSFT, and Wei, now reward both teams for their effort, not the result.


So, for every new product that Wei wants to build, she is creating a separate entity and at least two separate teams trying to identify and solve the problem.  

","Product development gurus Marty Cagan, Rahul Vohra, and Wei Deng emphasize user-centric prototyping and separate entities for innovation and success."
Product:  What product to build?  How to position it? (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlphokiVnRnsRDKA_d48QIpmy5VBBfn4760wS8WfQ1Q/edit ,"Product:  What product to build?  How to position it? (3 min)

I often hear the following line: ""We have built a new product and are ready to launch it, but we haven't yet figured out how to position it to customers in a way that resonates with them.""
When I hear this, I know that the Product Development process has gone far off the rails.
Here is what the Product Development process should be:
Talk to lots and lots and lots of people who are potential customers. Ask them, ""What are your core problems and frustrations related to … (the area that you are focused on)?""


Repeat back to each potential customer what you heard them say, by stating ""I think I heard you say …."" 
Then ask, ""Is that right?"" 


Keep repeating back until they say ""Yes.""


Write down every customer type and problem. Start to see the trends. Put them in buckets. Example 
Customers with over 1,000 employees have this pain.
Customers in FL have this pain.
The Marketing departments have this pain.


For each bucket (also called segment), ask. 
How many such customers are there?
How much money do they have to spend on a solution?
How good are the current alternative solutions?


Pick your beachhead. It should be the segment that has 
The most customers, with 
The most money to spend on a solution, and
The worst alternative current solutions


Now build a product that solves that segment's problem.
If you do this, the Positioning process is easy. It is simply …
State the problem that the customer has. Then … ""If you have this problem, we have your solution.""
That is it. 
If you have built a product, and don't yet know exactly which individual decision-makers have the problem that this product solves, then you have done things in reverse order. 
Start over. Go talk to lots and lots and lots of people who are potential customers. Ask them, ""What are your core problems and frustrations related to … (the area that you are focused on)?""
They will then give you your positioning.


If you are a customer, be careful. You are just one customer. It would be best if you talked to a range of customers to discover common pain points. If you build for just one customer (even if it's you), you are likely building a customized solution, not a product. 


When you have a product with users, and you are continually talking to them about their ongoing problems, one question that quickly arises is: ""Which users' problems should I solve?""
Rahul Vohra of Superhuman has come up with a very useful framework to answer this question. The ones that truly love your product and would feel great sadness if they no longer had access to it. They are your power users and evangelists. Double down on them, and those like them!


By the way, this customer problem discovery process is so powerful that it works even when a company already has a scaled product. One of my portfolio companies sells a product to hospitals. And they are winning. They are already a unicorn and growing quickly. But the CEO could see that hospitals are not great customers because they don't have much cash, and they make decisions by committee (i.e., very slowly and painfully). 
I asked him what customers he'd like to have. He said: ""Pharma and medical device companies. They have tons of cash and are streamlined."" I said: ""Great, then go talk to them and find out what their problems are. See if you can solve them."" 
He did. He spent three months doing so. He discovered their primary problem and realized that he could easily build a solution to this problem by tapping into his current solution.  He described the solution to pharma and device CEOs and they love it.  
He has already collected several million dollars in advance payments to develop the solution (which will be easy to develop). Once created, the current contracts will turn into hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, with much more TAM behind that. 
Six months ago, he thought he'd never get past $2-3b in value. Now he's confident he'll get to $100b. 
Lesson: Never stop doing this customer problem discovery process. Both with your current customers and the customers you wish you had. ","Develop products by understanding customer pain points, focusing on the segment with most need, money, and poor solutions. Position accordingly."

By Tom Shields and Matt Mochary

(Add video of Matt explaining this.)

Achieving product-market fit for a new product when you only have 2-3 people in your company (i.e., a YC startup) is hard. Doing it when your company has hundreds of people is damn near impossible. Why? And is there a better way?!
To understand this dynamic, let's look at product development through three broad stages of company development:
Stage 1: Building
In this stage, 2-3 founders (YC startup size) prototype a product and find product-market fit. There is no brand equity to worry about and no real concerns about security or scalability (because there are no real users yet). The development team is small enough to move fast and break things without the burden of commenting, testing, and hardening their code. All they care about is getting feedback from their customers, experimenting, and iterating as fast as possible. This allows them to learn and optimize their solution very quickly.
Stage 2: Scaling
Once the company finds product-market fit, they begin to sign customers and grow the team. The product now needs to be secure and scalable. The team needs to onboard new engineers, so the code needs to be commented on and tested. The company begins to develop a brand and a reputation that they need to protect, so they want high confidence that new features work well before being deployed. All of this necessarily slows down the pace of development and deployment. 
Stage 3: Broadening
Now the company wants to broaden the product portfolio, so they need to build new products. The problem is that the team's DNA is now oriented towards protecting the brand, so a new product will take a long time before it's good enough for sharing. The developers are used to building scalable and clean code, which takes longer than rough prototypes. Under these constraints, it's impossible to get customer feedback and learn quickly enough. Other newer and smaller startups will learn 10x faster and beat them every time.
Solution:
The only way to successfully build a new product within a scaled company is to recreate the early-stage building mode. This means taking a team of 3-5 dedicated people and making them autonomous. This regains all the build fast elements of the YC startup. No brand, no customers, no need for security, scalability, or industrial code.

(At the extreme end, this means putting the team in an entirely new C corp [wholly owned by the parent], with a new name and therefore no brand to protect.) 
This new group will still require a ""founder mentality."" And it is hard to hire true founders because they're usually founding companies. (Although, it is worth trying to find x-founders whose companies didn’t succeed, and they now want to join a successful company.)  The key is to create a founder mentality with the existing team. To create this frame of mind, every week, ask the team how they ""failed."" Then congratulate them on each instance because it meant that they tried, took a risk, and, most importantly, learned. This way, the team is re-trained from seeing failure as something that removes approval to something that grants approval. This is the only way they can get into the experimentation mode that rapid new product development requires.


Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health, shares that she has created a new C Corp called Billterms.  The results:  
It works!  
Customers aren’t trying to push requests about the base Clipboard product, because they aren’t talking to Clipboard, they’re talking to Billterms. So problem-discovery is focused entirely on Billterms.  
Also, we can experiment wildly because the brand isn’t associated with Clipboard at all.  If someone has a negative experience with one tool, they are still willing to try the other tool.   
We’ve actually created a separate C Corp for each of the 4 new products that we are building.
My next experiment is to bring each of these new product teams to work together in person. The rest of the company is remote, but I think new product development happens better and faster in person.

This method works well for rebuilding the existing core product as well.  Technology moves quickly.  There comes a point when rebuilding the core product will produce better results than continuing to add on to the existing version.  But it can often take 6-18 months to rebuild the now-large tool.  Therefore, continue to staff the core product, and treat v2 as a new product and therefore a new company. 
This is common practice.  I can think of 4 companies that I coach that have completely rebuilt their core product.  And one that rebuilds its core product every 12-24 months.  ","Developing a new product in a scaled company is challenging due to growth constraints, but can be achieved by recreating early-stage autonomy."
Recruiting and Onboarding (15 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHHQok1GAPpUdx_apA_M6RWB7753zbBhac8-9H2dG_M/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Recruiting and Onboarding (15 min)
When recruiting, the goal is to find great people and attract them to your company. Since this is so important, you could rationalize throwing lots and lots of time at this problem, which most growing companies do. Unfortunately, this time-suck will grind most of your other functions to a halt. 
The key is efficiency. And to be efficient, you must spend as little time as possible with the candidates you don't hire (quick evaluation) and as much time as possible with the candidates you want to and do hire (building a relationship, onboarding/training). Remember that each minute you spend with a candidate you don't hire is a minute that you aren't spending with the team member you want to hire.
Of all the recruiting systems I have seen, the best description is in the book Who by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. I have summarized the Recruiting System in Appendix B. If this system resonates with you, I highly recommend reading the book Who in its entirety to understand the details. 
The key in this system is that predictive information does not come from the interviews themselves. There are plenty of people who are good at interviewing but do not perform in the job. Instead, the predictive information comes from how a person actually performs or how they have performed in the past. 
If the person is not currently in a full-time job, hire them on a contract basis to work with you for 1-3 months. You will then see how they actually perform. This step is the most predictive information you can collect.
But most good people are already in a full-time job and are loathe to leave it unless they are offered another full-time job. For these people, the key is to collect information about how they have performed in previous jobs. And the best way to do that is through extensive reference interviews. 
Therefore, the goal of the in-person interview becomes primarily to collect the names and contact of the people that the candidate has worked for and with throughout their career (top-grading interview). The hiring manager then uses this list to reach out to 5-7 people to conduct reference interviews. And this is where you discover the predictive information. 
Before Recruiting
As the hiring manager, write out a ninety-day roadmap for the position you need to fill. This roadmap includes all the goals you expect the new team member to hit within the first ninety days of joining. This action is critical for successful onboarding. During the interview process, share this roadmap with the candidate to make sure that she is excited about these goals.
Selling

The best candidates will get offers from other companies. So, you need to not only evaluate but also sell from the very beginning.
Building a relationship
Just as in fundraising, building a relationship with a recruit will vastly increase her likelihood of joining your company. The best candidates can work anywhere. Make sure that they want to work with you.
Do this by using the same techniques mentioned earlier. Ask the candidate about herself, reflect on what she says, and remember what she said the next time you meet with her. If you have already used this method during your initial fundraising, you will know its effectiveness. 
Speed
There is another critical variable to making the recruit want to accept your offer: speed! A recruit wants to feel loved. The easiest way to accomplish that is to have a fast process from start to finish. Each day of delay sends the message, ""We don't have conviction about you."" 
If you doubt whether this dynamic exists, recall when you raised money. Which investors were the most compelling for you? The ones that responded and decided quickly, or those that lingered in their decision process for weeks or months? Benchmark and Sequoia are famous for making investment offers within days (and sometimes hours) of meeting a company that excites them. 
The offer from investors is always pending due diligence, so there is plenty of time after-the-fact for the investment firm to discover critical information about your company. In recruiting, you also can make an offer to the candidate ""pending reference interviews."" 
Here's what a streamlined process looks like:
You contact a candidate and schedule a short phone interview.
At the phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player.
Immediately schedule a second phone screen with the Hiring Manager as soon as possible. If, at this second phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player, then ...
Immediately schedule a full day of onsite interviews to meet with all of the needed interviewers. This will be easy because you already follow this Calendar Cadence, so all required interviewers have scheduled to be at the office (or available remotely) on recruiting day, ready to interview. (Using this method, you can easily have several candidates for onsite interviews on the same day.) At the end of that day, the interview team convenes and makes a decision. 
(Some people question whether one round of interviews is enough to make a good decision. The answer is yes because the real information comes from the Reference Interviews that follow. Google has found that more interviews do not lead to better decisions. In fact, they limit interviews to 5 total of 30 minutes each! They have found that the marginal benefit of more or more extended interviews is close to zero.)
If ""yes,"" reach out to the candidate that evening and say: ""We love you. We want you to work at our company. We want to make you an offer pending reference interviews.""
Have a verbal discussion about what a successful offer would look like. Ask the candidate to complete this phrase: ""I would join your company as long as _________.""
Address each request. If all are doable, move to the next stage.
Conduct the reference interviews. Do not skip or skimp on this stage. These interviews are the most crucial part of the interview process and give the most accurate information about how a candidate will perform.
If the reference interviews are wildly positive, reach back out to the candidate: ""The reference interviews were great. We'd like for you to join our company. If we make you the following offer (explain every detail of the offer including benefits, etc.), would you accept?"" Go back and forth until you have a verbal agreement.
Invite the candidate for an ""offer ceremony,"" wherein you make them the offer, and they accept. (There is more detail on the offer process below.)
This process can take as little as two weeks from the first contact to the accepted offer. If your process becomes that fast, your acceptance rate from top candidates will start to resemble that of Benchmark and Sequoia.
Then, when your acceptance rate from top candidates begins to soar, become incredibly picky and tighten up your initial selection criteria (from the first 15-minute video call) to choose only the best of the best.
Spouse
While the candidate herself is excited about the idea of working with you, there is another person in the equation who does not get the benefit of being charmed by you and the prospects of the company: the candidate's spouse. They feel fear and have thoughts like
""We have two kids in private school; how can we afford to reduce our current household income by 50%?"" 
""Will this startup ever really pan out, or is it just another flash in the pan like all of those others?""
I find that the biggest blocker to a candidate saying ""Yes"" is their spouse's fear of saying ""No."" The antidote for someone's fear is to make them feel heard. Therefore, I always ask to talk directly to the spouse. I say to the candidate, ""I know that you are excited about this company, but I imagine that your spouse is feeling fear and has many concerns. I'd like for him/her to have those concerns addressed directly and feel that he/she has a direct line of communication with me. Would you be willing to introduce me to him/her so that we can connect directly?""
The answer is usually: ""Let me ask my spouse."" And then, a day later, the connection is made. During the call with the spouse, I simply listen and repeat back the thoughts that I hear. If I can address them, I do. But that is not necessary. Acknowledging the thoughts is really all that is needed. The spouse usually says something like, ""Thank you for doing this. In all of our years together, no boss of my spouse has ever reached out to me like this.""
The candidate usually accepts shortly after that. 
Compensation
How much compensation do you offer new team members? How much cash and equity?
My preferred method is to:
Discover the market compensation for the position (role and seniority). There are plenty of online compensation studies that show this. Market compensation is whatever a big company (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) pays for this position.
Discover the amount of cash that the new team member would need to live comfortably (housing, food, transportation, child expenses, etc.)
It is up to the startup to match the market compensation level, not in cash as the larger companies do, but rather in a much lesser amount of cash (no less than the amount needed to live comfortably), plus equity to bridge the difference. 
Here is an example to show how you calculate the equity portion. Let's say the position is a Level 3 Engineer who is paid $300,000 in total compensation at Google. The team member requires $120,000 in cash to live comfortably and invests the remainder in startup equity. Calculate the amount of equity by taking the difference between market and cash ($300,000-$120,000=$180,000) and multiplying it by four years ($180,000 x 4 = $720,000). This amount is then divided by a factor between 1 and 2, representing a very conservative estimate of the increase in equity value over four years. A 1 represents no expected increase in Value. A 2 represents a 2x expected increase in Value. If 1.5 were used (which is the most common), the final amount would be $720,000 / 1.5 = $480,000. So grant this amount in options; however much equity it purchases at the company's current valuation—the options vest over four years.
Then I prefer to make an offer that allows the new team member to choose how much they want to invest in the startup equity at three different levels. The lowest cash level would be the level needed to live comfortably. 
Here's an example in which the company is currently worth $50mm. The company will likely need another major financing round and optional pool refresh before it reaches maturity, which is an expected 50% dilution to the current cap table. A $1 billion eventual value of the company would result in a 10x increase in the equity value. (20x increase in company value x 50% dilution = 10x increase in equity value.)
The three options would be:


 
Annual Cash
Equity Worth
Expected Value at $1 billion company valuation
1
$120,000
$480,000
$4,800,000
2
$140,000
$426,666
$4,266,666
3
$160,000
$361,333
$3,613,333


The hope is that the new team member believes so fully in the company (and the power of the asymmetric bet) that they choose one of the two higher equity offers. This equity is thus an investment that the team member is making in the company. And with a huge advantage: They make the investment with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power.
Making the Offer
Before making an offer, it is critical to know that the candidate will accept. Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:
""I will join the company as long as ….""
They then should state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.
Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:
""If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?""
If they say yes, then make them an offer. If you skip this step and simply make them the offer, it is very common for them to ask for a few more things after-the-fact (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. It is far better to get the candidate to pre-agree in complete detail before making the offer. Then the relationship begins with a resoundingly positive ""Yes! Thank you! I'm so excited!""
The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. We recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Invite the candidate to receive the offer in person. Create a ritual out of this process. Here are some possibilities:
Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
Give company schwag. 
Give hugs and high-fives. 
Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable.
Onboarding
Most companies spend extraordinary resources of time, money, and equity to bring on a new team member, and then almost entirely drop the ball on quickly getting that team member onboarded and up to speed on how the company works so that they can begin making a full contribution. Don't make this mistake! Give onboarding even more attention, time, and energy than you give to recruiting. After all, many of the people you are spending time with during recruiting will not become team members. Whereas 100% of the people that you spend time with during onboarding are already team members. Focus your energy there!
Write a checklist of all of the information that a team member would need to be fully effective. Write all of this information down and make a video of it. Share this checklist, the written/video info, and the 90-day roadmap with each new team member as early as you can, even before they start.
On their first day at the office, have them come in two hours after the normal start of the day so that there are plenty of people there to greet the new team member. Assign each new team member a buddy with whom they'll check in each day for fifteen minutes for the first two weeks. These fifteen minutes are for the new team member to ask questions that arise and for the buddy to ensure that the new team member is going through the checklist.
Todd McKinnon of Okta takes it a step further, which I recommend that you do as well: ""My best tip when onboarding a new direct report. Meet with them for 1 hour daily for the first month. Simple but effective.""
","Efficient recruiting is crucial. Spend less time with candidates you don't hire, more with those you do. Reference interviews are key."

First, we look for the ability to do the job that is needed today. Second, we look for flexibility and adaptability for what the role may become tomorrow.
 
Source
We are constantly sourcing, identifying the who before a new hire is really needed.
There are three sources of candidates:
1. Referrals from our network.
2. Recruiters
3. Researchers 
Referrals. Of these three, referrals from our personal and professional networks are by far the most effective.
                We need to ask ourselves:  “Who are the most talented people I know that _____ should hire?”  And then ask all the talented people in our network, and every talented person that we meet “Who are the most talented people that you know that _____ should hire?”  Ask our advisors, customers, partners, suppliers.  Join a professional organization.  Ask there.


                Please fill out your Top 20 candidates.
An objective that will go on each of our scorecards is: ""Source one candidate who passes the _____ phone screen per quarter.""
Recruiters.  We occasionally use recruiters. They are not as effective as our own network.  And we understand that to be effective at all, they need to know and understand _____.  It is pointless to engage recruiters unless we bring them inside the kimono and fully expose them to _____.  We do so by sharing the scorecard with them, as well as every detail of our reaction to candidates they propose.  
Researchers.  These are people who research networks and generate names, but do not reach out directly to candidates.  We rarely use researchers.
 
Here is our Process for Sourcing:

Gamify the process. Give a prize to whoever reaches out to the most people (or whatever other metric you want to use).
Deputizing friends of _____. We offer a referral bonus of $______ and regularly ask friends of _____ for referrals.
Hiring recruiters. When we hire recruiters, we give them full access to our scorecards and our reaction to candidates.
ATS (Applicant Tracking System). We are relentless about entering all relevant information into our ATS. This system is everyone's responsibility. While one owner of this list will check it weekly for ""not filled out the information,"" we will pester each other to enter this information whenever we see holes. 
Select
We have a set of four interviews that allow us to rate a person against our scorecard. To be great interviewers, we must get out of the habit of passively witnessing how somebody acts during an interview. And instead, use the four interviews to collect facts and data about how they have performed over decades.
Screening Interview
Topgrading Interview
Focused Interview
Reference Interview
Phone Screen Interview
The goal is to eliminate people who are inappropriate for the position as soon as possible. One can conduct this by phone, and it should not last more than 30 minutes. Preview that it will last 15 minutes, then extend to 30 during the call only if the candidate appears to be excellent.
The Hiring Manager will assign the first screener. If the candidate passes the first screen, the Hiring Manager will do the second screen.
Read the scorecard just before the call.
Set expectations:
""Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I'd like to spend the first 10 minutes of our call getting to know you. After that, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about us. Sound good?""
(It is essential to get their information first so that what you get isn't simply a parroting back of what _____ is looking for.)
The script:
1. ""What are your career goals?""
(If his/her goals sound like an echo of the _____ website or they don't have any, screen them out.)
2. ""What are you good at professionally?""
(Push them to give you 8-12 positives, with examples, so that you can build a complete picture of their capabilities. You are listening for strengths that match the scorecard.)
3. ""What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?""
(Push them for real weaknesses, 5-8 of them. If they don't respond thoroughly enough, call them on it. If they still don't, then say the following: ""If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up reference calls with your bosses, peers, and subordinates. What do you think they will say are some things that you are not good at, or not interested in?"")
4. ""Who were your last three bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 0-10 scale when we talk to them?""
(Press for details of why each person would give them such a rating. We are looking for consistent 8-10s. A 6 is actually a 2. But ask why it's a 6.)
1. What are your career goals?
2. What are you good at professionally?
3. What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?
4. Who were your last three bosses, and how will they rate your performance on a 0-10 scale when talking to them?
And then, it is essential to go deeper. Throughout the interview, get curious. Ask follow-up questions that start with ""What,"" ""How,"" or ""Tell me more.""
Examples:
• ""What do you mean?""
• ""What is an example of that?""
• ""How did you do that?""
• ""How did that feel?""
(Developer hires will have an extra screening step of performing a programming test.) 
The goal of this phone screen is to weed out candidates quickly. If you can't definitively say: ""This is an A candidate,"" then hit the gong. It is better for us to miss out on an A player than to waste many precious hours on a borderline case that turns out to be a B or C player. If we weed harshly, we will spend more time with candidates who are known A players.
If you think this is an A player, let the candidate know that you believe they are great and that you are open to extending this phone interview to get to know them more and answer their questions about _____. Jump into ""selling"" mode.

If you think that the candidate is not an A player, end the call at the scheduled time (15 minutes, hopefully). Within 24 hours, inform them that you appreciated their time, but you will not be moving forward with them at this time. ""Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. We do not feel that our needs for this role match your strengths. That being said, we will be hiring for many more roles in the future, and we hope to be able to reach back out to you again.""
While it may feel difficult to say ""no"" to people, it is disrespectful to let them linger. The vast majority of people prefer a quick ""no"" to a slow one, or worse yet, no response at all.
Now, let's get back to that candidate who is an A.
Selling
In addition to getting curious about a candidate's passions, dreams, and personal life (as described in Building Trust and Like), the key to successfully selling a candidate on ____ is giving them enough information so that they will see that at _____ they will have: 
Fit, Family, Freedom, Fun.
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap, and their Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going.
Family. ""What can we do to make this change as easy as possible for your family?"" Ask about their family. Get to know their names, ages, etc. Ask what concerns and needs their family members have. Meet those needs. Ideally, meet their family in person (or at a minimum, speak to their spouse on the phone), discover their needs directly, and meet those needs.
Freedom. ""At ____, we collaboratively set Company, Department and Individual OKRs at the beginning of each quarter. Your Individual OKRs means that I will not micromanage you. In our regular 1-1s, I will ask you to update me on your progress toward your OKRs, and offer you support whenever you run into obstacles. I encourage you to talk to my team to see what I am like to work with.""
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____.
At the end of the phone interview, let the candidate know that you would like to immediately schedule the next interview (either the second phone interview or the on-site interviews).
On-Site Interviews
For the on-site interviews, schedule interviews back-to-back (with some break time in between) with all of the needed decision-makers, followed by a decision meeting at the end of the day attended by all interviewers. The goal is to get all required buy-in for a yes/no decision in one day of interviews. 
This day of interviews will include:
A Topgrading interview
Several Focused interviews
The schedule for the interviewers will look something like this:
830-900am Interviewers meeting. Here's what's going to happen today. Review scorecard, candidate's resume, notes from screening interviews, and roles/responsibilities for the day.
845-900am A team member greets the candidate and orients them to the day ahead.
900-1100am Topgrading Interview. (1-2 hours)
1100-noon Focused Interview.
Noon-100pm Lunch with _____.
100-400pm Focused Interviews
400-415pm Host thanks the candidate and explains the next steps.
415-500pm Decision Meeting. The interview team meets to rate the scorecard. Hiring Manager makes a YES/NO decision to conduct reference calls or terminate the process.
Topgrading Interview
The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's story and patterns. These stories and practices are predictive of the candidate's future performance. Start from the beginning and move forward chronologically. Create chapters of a job (or groups of jobs) that last 3-5 years. This interview should take about 2 hours (3 hours for a CEO, 1 hour for entry-level). It is worth the time. For every hour we spend Topgrading a candidate, we'll save 100s of hours not dealing with B or C players.
The Hiring Manager should conduct the Topgrading Interview and a colleague who wants to learn the method by observing.
In the interview, first set expectations:
""Thank you for visiting us today. We are going to do a chronological interview and walk through each job you've had. For each job, I am going to ask you five core questions.
What were you hired to do? 
What accomplishments are you most proud of? 
What were some low points during that job? 
Who were the people you worked with? 
Why did you leave that job?
At the end of the interview, we will discuss your career goals and aspirations, and you can ask me questions about us. 

80 percent of the process will take place in this room, but if we mutually decide to move forward, we will conduct reference calls to complete the process.
Finally, while this sounds lengthy, it will go remarkably fast. It is my job to guide the pace of the discussion. Sometimes I will ask you to go into more depth; other times, I will ask that we move on to the next topic. I'll try to make sure that we leave plenty of time to cover your most recent and, therefore, most relevant jobs.
Any questions before we begin?""
The script:
For each job or group of jobs (lasting 3-5 years).
1. What were you hired to do?
You are trying to create a picture of their scorecard as if they had one. What were their mission and key outcomes (or Objectives and Key Results)?
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
Hopefully, these accomplishments will match the outcomes described in the first question.
3. What were some low points during that job?
Do not let the candidate off the hook. Reframe the question over and over again until you get honest answers.
4. Who were the people you worked with? Specifically:
i. What was your boss' name, and how do you spell that? What was it like working with him/her? What will he/she tell me were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?
Follow the script exactly. By letting the candidate know that we will be contacting these references, the candidate will become much more truthful. This is the most crucial question we ask during the Topgrading Interview, as it gives us the information needed to do the Reference Interviews. For the most recent or significant job, also ask:
ii. Who were your peers on the team, and how do you spell their names? 
iii. Who were the members of your team, and how do you spell their names?
Again, these are critical questions that will enable the Reference Interviews. 

iv. How would you rate the team you inherited on an A, B, and C scale? What changes did you make? Did you hire anybody? Fire anybody? How would you rate the team when you left it on an A, B, and C scale?
Does the candidate accept the hand they have been dealt, or do they make changes to get a better hand? You can also use the reference check method to get more information: ""When we speak with members of your team, what will they say are your biggest strengths and weaknesses as a manager?""
5. Why did you leave that job?
Was the candidate promoted, recruited, or fired? Get very curious about why?
To conduct this interview well, you will have to:
1. Interrupt. Do so tactfully. But do not let a candidate ramble. Doing so will only hurt their chances of success because it will chew up valuable time without conveying important information. Expect to interrupt the candidate once every 3-4 minutes. 
The proper way to interrupt someone is to be positive and use reflective listening: ""Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!"" The candidate says: ""Yes."" Then you immediately say:"" You were telling me earlier about launching that email campaign. I'd love to hear what that was like? How well did it go?""
2. Three Ps. Use the 3 Ps to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in context.
i. How did your performance compare to the previous year's performance?
ii. How did your performance compare to the plan?
iii. How did your performance compare to that of your peers?
3. Push versus Pull. People who perform well are generally pulled to more significant opportunities.
For each job change, determine if it was a push or a pull.
Push. ""It was mutual."" ""It was time for me to leave.""
Pull. ""My biggest client hired me."" ""My old boss recruited me to a bigger job.""
4. Painting a Picture. You'll know that you understand what a candidate is saying when you can see a picture of it in your mind. Put yourself in their shoes.

5. Stopping at the Stop Signs. If you see or hear inconsistencies, the candidate may be telling an untruth. If this happens, get curious, and dig deeper. Think of yourself as a biographer (positive), not an investigative journalist (negative).
Focused Interview
Three _____ers (not the Hiring Manager) will be asked to conduct 3 Focused Interviews, each 50 minutes. The focused interview is a chance to involve other team members and get more specific information about the candidate. Focus the interview on the outcomes (skills) and competencies (culture fit) of the scorecard. Get curious after every answer by using the ""What? How? Tell me more"" framework. We split the Outcomes and Competencies in the scorecard into three sections, allowing each interviewer to focus on one area (⅓ of the Outcomes and ⅓ of the Competencies).
Set the stage:
1. ""The purpose of this interview is to talk about ____________(fill in the blank with the Outcomes and Competencies in the Scorecard that you are going to review).""
The script:
1. ""Now we are going to talk about ___________ (fill in the blank with the next Outcome or Competency to be reviewed). 
2. What are your most significant accomplishments in this area during your career?
3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?""
The rating:
At the end of the day of on-site interviews, we hold a Decision Meeting. The entire interview team gathers. All submit their comments on the candidate in writing in the ATS system. We then declare our positions on each candidate.
Skill-Will Bull's Eye. We only choose candidates whose skill (what they can do) and will (what they want to do) matches our scorecard. This scorecard is their skill-will profile. For each item on the scorecard, rate the candidate's skill-will. Only rate people an A in whom you have a greater than 90% confidence that they can and will meet all outcomes and competencies.
Red Flags:
Here are the things to watch out for during the interview process that signal problems:
- Candidate does not mention past failures.
- Candidate exaggerates his or her answers.
- Candidate takes credit for the work of others.
- Candidate speaks poorly of past bosses.
- Candidate cannot explain job moves.
- Their family doesn't want them to take this job.
- For managerial hires, the candidate has never had to hire or fire anybody.
- Candidate is more interested in compensation and title than in the job itself and _____.
- Candidate tries too hard to look like an expert.
- Candidate is not curious about us or others. (Candidate is self-absorbed.)
The selection:
1. Update all the Scorecards.
2. Rate each candidate.
3. If we have no A's, restart the process to step 2: Source.
4. If we have one A, we make them an offer pending reference interviews.
5. If we have several A's, we rank them and offer pending reference interviews to the best A from among them. We try to find another role at _____ for the other A's.
Reference Interview
We do not skip the reference checks! The Reference Interviews are where we learn the truth about the candidate. These interviews give us by far the most accurate picture of the candidate's future performance.
1. We pick the proper references. Bosses, peers, and subordinates (sometimes 2-3 levels down). We do not use the reference list that the candidate gives us.
2. We ask the candidate to contact the references and set up the calls.
3. The Hiring Manager conducts at least 2 (but preferably 4) reference interviews, and other team members do at least 1 (but preferably 3) more for a total of at least 3 (but preferably 7).
The script:
1. ""In what context did you work with the person?""

2. ""What were the person's biggest strengths?""
Get curious by using the ""What? How? Tell me more"" framework.

3. ""What were the person's biggest areas for improvement back then?""
It is essential to say ""back then."" This expression liberates people to talk about fundamental weaknesses, assuming that the candidate has improved them by now. (In reality, past performance is an indicator of future performance.)

4. ""How would you rate his/her overall performance in that job on a scale of 0-10? What about his/her performance causes you to give that rating?""

5. ""The person mentioned that he/she struggled with ________ in that job. Can you please tell me more about that?""
People do not like to give negative references, so listen for cues. Faint or qualified praise is damning, as is hesitation.
From Danny An, Founder of TrustToken: 
“When asking for weaknesses or areas of improvement during interviews and reference calls, people answer more freely if you say, ""People shouldn't do the majority of things and should focus on areas where they can use their strengths. Understanding weaknesses demonstrates self-awareness."" 
Sell
Our decision to hire the candidate is only one part of the equation. The second and even more critical part is selling the candidate to join us. 
As described in Building Trust and Like, the key is to put yourself in the candidate's shoes. Find out what they care about. And then care about it yourself. Most people tend to care about …
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap, and their Individual Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going.
Family. ""What can we do to make this change as easy as possible for your family?"" Ask about their family. Get to know their names, ages, etc. Ask what concerns and needs they have. Meet those needs. (Ideally, meet their family in person, discover their needs directly, and meet those needs.)
Freedom. ""The Individual Roadmap allows you the freedom to make decisions. I will not micromanage you."" Encourage the candidate to do reference checks on you to see what you are like to work with.
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____.
Fortune. ""If you accomplish your objectives, and we as a company accomplish ours, you will likely make x over the next 5-10 years.""
Selling happens throughout the recruiting process. Here are key moments to put yourself in a candidates shoes and address the issues above:
1. When you source
2. When you interview
3. The time between your verbal offer and the candidate's acceptance (reach out to them repeatedly during this time!)
4. The time between the candidate's acceptance and his/her first day (yes, they still aren't really here yet; keep reaching out to them!)
5. The new hire's first 100 days on the job (yes, they are still evaluating; keep addressing what they care about!) Be persistent. Think lots of touches! Too many candidates are lost because they feel abandoned once they are offered or arrive at the company.
Implementation
To implement this recruiting system:
1. Announce it to the company.
2. Train all Hiring Managers and interviewers.
3. Implement the schedule and process. Enter the process and questions in the ATS system.
4. Put ""Source 1 great candidate"" on everyone's quarterly scorecard (i.e., OKRs)
Legal
Don't discriminate. We hire people on one criteria only: whether they are likely to perform the job or not. Keep in mind the following:
1. Relevance. Defining the outcomes and competencies will ensure that we are judging on relevant criteria.
2. Standardization. Having a standard process ensures fairness across all groups.
3. Non-discriminatory language. We always use ""he/she"" or ""they."" No derogatory language toward anyone, ever.
4. No illegal questions: Anything related to marital status, intention to have children, pregnancy, date or place of birth, medical condition, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical or mental handicaps.

As a result, people often say, “Wow, how do you get so much done in so little time?!”  The truth is, I’m not special.  Anyone can learn to do this.  The secret is having a bias towards action.

now as the COO of Mochary Method as we build the Method into software and simultaneously train world-class coaches
when I was Chief of Staff to Matt Mochary and had to help him feel like a Superhuman
when I was Head of Operations at On Deck and tasked with launching 20+ fellowships in 2021, and
when I bootstrapped my first company, a boutique music school, to $1mm in ARR
Below is the framework I use.

‍

STEP 1:  DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?
First, just because you can get something done, doesn’t mean you should.

And just because someone has asked you to do something, doesn’t mean you should do it.

Before you agree to do something, remember that for every request you say “yes” to, you’re saying “no” to something else.  Is that trade-off worth it?

Here are a few more questions you can ask yourself:

If you are a manager: how important is it for you yourself to do it?  Instead, can you delegate it to one of your direct reports?
If you are an individual contributor: is the task in harmony with what your manager’s priorities are?  Is it in the company’s best interest?*
*For a deeper understanding on what “company’s best interest” means, please read No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings.  Here is an excellent summary on the book by Matt Mochary.

TL;DR:  should you say yes to that thing?  Think carefully about the time spent and the payoff for doing it.

👉  Here’s a tip:  try to say yes to things that are only full-bodied “yes.”  That means saying yes when your head, heart, and gut are all in agreement.  (Hat tip to Kat Agostino for this amazing insight.)

‍

☝ Regina’s personal experience: I used to have a hard time saying no to people and tasks that didn’t energize me.  Then, one day, I realized that everything I said half-bodied “yes”es to zapped away time that Matt needed me working on high-output tasks. As a result, I started experimenting with valuing my time at the same cost as Matt’s hourly rate. The result:  All of a sudden, it became much easier to say no.
‍

STEP 2A:  IS THIS THE BEST THING I CAN BE DOING WITH MY TIME RIGHT NOW?
If you have decided that it is, indeed, worth it to do the task and that it’s in the company’s best interest, the next step is to ask yourself:  Is this the most important task on my plate right now?

When I decide how to structure my work day and what stuff I’ll get done, I first consult my Actions Towards Goals.

💡 Here is a framework for figuring out your actions towards goals:

Look at your company’s goals.  This can exist in the form of an MVV (Mission, Vision, Values), OKRs and KPIs, or a Product Roadmap if your company is pre-product market fit.

For further reading on Product Roadmap, please read this.
For further reading on Mission, Vision, and Values, take a look at MM’s vision doc here.
‍‍
Look at your Areas of Responsibility (AORs).  If your company doesn’t have an AOR list, I highly encourage you to help them implement one.  That way, there is no ambiguity in who owns what processes across the entire org.

To implement AORs, check this out.‍
‍
Look at your action tracker.  Look at the agreements you’ve made with others on the tasks you have promised.

For further information, I recommend checking out my Asana as an Agreements Tracker playlist to see how to implement one in your org.
If you’re a manager, your main job is likely following up on actions with your immediate team and cross-functionally with other department heads.

If you’re an IC, your main job is likely working on projects your manager and you have collectively agreed on you owning.

‍

STEP 2B:  EXAMPLE: COMPANY GOALS → PERSONAL WORK GOALS → ACTION
👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)

Below are screenshots from my own personal actions tracker.  I answer the following questions, step by step:

What are the company goals?
Based on those goals, what should my work goals be?
What are the actions I can do to finish those goals?
Regina’s example...
Here are my current company goals, pulled from our Mission, Vision, Values doc.


Here is how I’ve chosen my Actions Towards Goals (notice that each section has one action item: product, people, and self.)


And as a result, here is what I choose to do daily because it is the best use of my time:


After going through this line of questioning, it becomes abundantly clear what I have to do to move the needle forward.  Everything else is a distraction.

I reevaluate this list of priorities on a weekly basis to make sure I’m still on track.

‍

STEP 3A:  HOW CAN I MAKE THIS ACTION HAPPEN IN THE NEXT 30 MINUTES?
Post it note on a laptop that says: ""Is there an action here?"" (Prompt) ""What is the action here?""
This was the post-it that inspired Nate to ask me about bias towards action, and actually the post-it that started this entire blog post.
Recently, I was teaching Nate Forster, Matt Mochary’s newest Chief of Staff and my successor in the role, how to get sh*t done quickly.

I taught Nate that if he wanted to be massively productive, any time someone gave him a task he decided was worth doing, or he assigned himself something, I encouraged him to ask himself that question.

He then joked that Frank Slootman, the CEO of Snowflake, wrote in his book Amp It Up that the #1 question he asked his team was, “What can we do to make this happen today?”

I suppose, then, my mantra is just Frank Slootman’s mantra on steroids: “How can I make this action happen in the next 30 minutes?”

One of the biggest hurdles of having a bias towards action is expecting perfection right from the get-go.

Rather than ...

jumping down the rabbit hole of hypothetical “what-ifs” that never happen, or
waiting to ship until a product is utterly perfect,
...instead, optimizing for getting something in front of an audience and iterating from there is the best way to make progress towards goals.

☝️  A NOTE FOR MANAGERS
When I work with my team, I find that this is a helpful prompt in promoting a bias towards action culture.  It puts them in the driver’s seat, helps them lean into their autonomy, and gives them decision-making power.

In fact, the semantics here matter.

Matt and I have gotten in a habit of requesting that our teammates declare what they’re going to do and actively solicit our feedback.

Here's an example of what you can send to your direct reports to challenge them into acting with autonomy.  Notice how I write to Sabrina, “What do you intend to do?”  This has worked for every person who reports to me, regardless of their seniority level.


‍

STEP 3B:  EXAMPLE:  SHIP IT FASTER THAN AN MVP
Tweet from Joe Brown that reads ""In April we'll be launching an app on @bubble that will handle 20,000-30,000 concurrent users in its first month. and of course, @alanpodemski is just making the tastiest UI elements for this thing with a screenshot showing a task being completed.
Joe (@cuhpajo) is so excited to launch our app that he’s throwing out all sorts of teasers about it.  If you’re reading this... now you know what he’s talking about.  :)
👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)

One great example I have on truncating timelines is Mochary Method’s work using no-code.

First, custom software takes a long time to build.

Mochary Method is creating the all-in-one solution for startups to run their companies effectively.  But we all know that takes a long time.  So, what next?

The solution:  I was curious on whether no-code could be an effective solution for prototyping our software.

So, a few months ago, we began working with Joe Brown and the team at Smaal Co to get an MVP off the ground, all built in Bubble.

We were given an estimate that our entire software would take around four months to build.  MVPs are supposed to be the quickest things to ship, right?  Right.  So that should be the fastest we can get something off the ground.

But what if that was wrong?

We had an even more radical idea:  what if we could build another tool concurrently that could be shipped in a matter of weeks?  This would prove whether we could even build a proper MVP in Bubble to begin with.

Using the same “30-minutes” thinking principle, I challenged Joe to build us a no-code tool, with design and database architecture able to integrate into the larger tool, all in a matter of two weeks.

Sure enough, Joe said yes.  And two weeks later, we had a product that worked!  This gave us the confidence that we could, indeed, prototype using Bubble.

‍


The proposal to craft a working prototype complete with design and database architecture in a matter of days.
‍


The resulting prototype, built in a matter of days and ready to test.
‍

But why stop there?  We were on a roll and loved no-code.  After completing that project, we asked: was there another piece the Smaal Team could create in the same timeline?

When we asked, Joe say he could build us another tool on our Santa’s wishlist of no-code products, but that tool would take at least month.  What followed was a conversation of how we could make it happen faster.

This first photo is of the proposal suggesting our tool be built in a four-week timeline, with some added time for QA testing before launch.

‍


Initial proposal: 4 week timeline.
‍

The next photo was my back-and-forth conversation with Joe on what action items he could take to make the development go faster, which resulted in an accelerated timeline.

‍


‍

In the end, we ended up agreeing to ship the Energy Audit tool in a little over two weeks.  This was faster than the original suggested timeline of a month (or more!), just because I asked:  “How can we make this happen faster?”

‍

STEP 4:  WHAT CAN I ACCOMPLISH BEFORE SOMEONE ASSIGNS ME AN ACTION?
The final step (Frank Slootman’s mantra on double-steroids) is:

What action items can I give myself and do to make this goal happen before anyone assigns me an action item?
An operator’s greatest superpower is being able to predict the needs of the organization before anyone asks them to do it.

This means preemptively going through the logic tree in Step 2a and giving yourself action items to act on before anyone else does it for you.

This is shockingly simple to implement.  All you have to do is ask yourself what actions you need to take to reach the goals.

In order to better illustrate how to do this, I’ve left a few examples from various chapters of my own life on how Bias Towards Action might look as an IC, a manager, and a founder.

‍

REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR
When I was Matt’s Chief of Staff, because Matt’s goals were effectively my goals, I would ask myself: “What is the next action item I can take to advance his goals before he even needs to think about asking me?”

This could apply to literally anything.  Asking this question helped me:

draft emails for Matt to follow up with VIPs in his inbox (corresponding goal:  get Matt to Inbox Zero and connect with interesting people)
line up plane tickets and hotel options for his next trip (corresponding goal:  Restore)
suggest meeting times for the next retrospective to debrief with the Engineering team (goal:  ship V1 of software by the end of the year)
The common theme was that Matt’s life was now plug-and-play:  he didn’t have to think because I did all the thinking for him.  This left him time and brain space to think about stuff that he loved thinking about: coaching and being the visionary of the software.

‍

REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS A MANAGER
In my previous job, I saw that the company I worked for had ambitious goals of launching 20+ fellowships (our “product”) by 2Q21.  Here was my thought pattern which made it happen before anyone asked me to think about it:

The company’s goal is to launch 20+ products by 2Q21.  Therefore, it is the Operations Department’s goal to put infrastructure and resourcing in place to handle 20+ products.
What are the building blocks to make create one product happen?Answer: playbook everything and document along the way.  Everyone needs to contribute to documentation efforts.‍
What is the minimum amount of resourcing we need to make one product?Answer:  we need at least one director and one operations associate to launch, and one EA per 3-5 product launches.‍
With that number, what do we need to make twenty products?Answer:  at least 20 operations associates, and at least 4 EAs to assist with said product launches provided we stagger product launches.‍
When do we need to start hiring by to hit our deadline of resourcing, training, and deploying operations associates?Answer:  yesterday.  Next-best day is today.‍
Which departments do we have to collaborate with in the company to make this work?Answer:  all of them.  Write out exactly what we need from every department and don’t stop until we get what we need from each of them.
The result of this bias-towards-action thinking was:

We were able to launch all 20 products by our given timeline
We were able to hire, train, and deploy 15 operations associates in one quarter
We had playbooks in the Operations department written in the event that I needed to pass the role onto someone else
The company was able to successfully raise $20mm in Series A funding, in part because of the hockey stick growth in revenue from the product launches

An example of one of the pieces of documentation created in order to accommodate scale.
REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS A FOUNDER
Lastly, I’ll share an example from my Founder days.  Before I was familiar with the term, we hit product-market fit.

We had a waiting list of clients that was 1.5 years long, there were over 100 people in and out of my apartment-turned-music-studio every week, and I had clients that were throwing fistfuls of money in my face for the chance of getting music lessons using my methodology.

Below was my line of questioning to go from a solo bootstrapper into a full-fledged music school.‍

‍What was the goal? Answer: create the best, world-class piano school in all of Los Angeles county.‍
What has to be true for that goal to happen? Answer: I need to hire and train teachers to teach using my methodology.  I need training seminars and a way to make my methodology repeatable (therefore, documenting everything.)  Lastly, I need an actual music space: my tiny apartment isn’t cutting it anymore.‍
What has to happen to make that scenario true? Answer: Find, hire, and train two teachers to absorb my methodology.  Document and record everything along the way.  Find a commercial space by mid-1Q17.‍
What is going to take the most time? Answer: Finding the commercial space with the needed specs:  at least 1000 sqft for all the grand pianos, within budget, easy to access for parents, and soundproofing installed.‍
What are the next actions? Answer: After finding the space...

Negotiate for landlord-paid improvements to get walls, flooring, etc. covered to keep us in budget.  Offer to cover soundproofing since it’s a music business-specific expense.
Get building permits + get architect’s blueprints approved.
Cause building company to build the whole damn thing in 14 days.
Have a furniture-building party with friends to pitch in to open the school in time.
The results:  we opened our doors in February 2017, scaled to well over $500k in bootstrapped revenue during the first year, and ended up hiring a lean team of five people.  Because I started from the goal and planned for what we needed, we were instantly profitable from the get-go.  To this day, the school continues to live on.

‍


One of the pictures from the before and after of renovation, a key part in scaling the company.
‍

CONCLUSION
Bias towards action can be cultivated and trained over time.  When you master this skill, you will apply it to all facets of your life with massive success.  At that point, congratulations — I think you’ve truly become an excellent operator.

There are several ways to create a trusted relationship between a Manager and her reports.
They include:
I notice and recognize the contributions you make.
I ask and remember the details about you as a human being.
I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers.
I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker.
I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution).
Let's dive deeper into each one.
Recognition
I notice and recognize the contributions you make. This action is quite simply Praise (13 min). Do it in every single 1-1, Team Meeting and All Hands Meeting. Carve out an amount of time (3-5 minutes) to declare this praise. 
In addition, I send direct messages to people each week, or even each day, to follow up and give appreciations (1 min). I block off one hour each week to do so. 
Personal relationship
I know and care about you as a human being. 
To show this on a superficial (but still meaningful) level, I ask and remember the details about you as a human being. 
This action creates Trust and Like (5 min). 
Collect this information in the next 1-1 that you have with each Report. 
1st 1-1 Meeting with Matt Mochary (5 min to read; 45 min to do)
In addition, start each 1-1, by saying ""Before we get started, can you please give me the update on (pick one: your significant other, your kids, your hobby, etc.)."" Then listen with genuine curiosity. 
I want to help you solve the challenges you face in your personal life, not just those in your work life. 
When asking about issues that you are facing in our 1-1s, I explicitly ask you about personal challenges that you are facing. I then help you unpack those and give them as much air-time as work issues. 
2nd (and beyond) 1-1 Meeting with Matt Mochary (2 min to read; 15 min to do)
Darkest Thoughts
I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers. 
I appreciate, acknowledge, accept or not, and create actions to address the thoughts about me. 
Feedback (15 min)
On the thoughts about the company, I help you get a resolution by helping you. 
Create a roadmap for the solution
Get a decision from me (if that is what is required)
Get a decision from higher up (if that is what is required) 
Issue Identification (2 min)
Decision-Making (8 min)
On the thoughts about your peers, I encourage you to address them directly. If that doesn't lead to resolution, you both clean escalate to me (I hear from both of you simultaneously), and then I adjudicate.
Universal Agreement Tracker
I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker. Here is why: Agreement-Tracker: why you need one (3 min) 
How you fit into the Mission and Vision
I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution). 
I create clear Mission, Vision, Values: How to create them.
I create with you clear OKRs: OKR Creation (6 min)
I make sure that your OKRs map directly to the company's Mission, Vision, and Values so that you see how necessary your contribution is.

Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)
We all want to be good at relationships. Whether we are a CEO, a Manager, or an Individual Contributor, how well we interact with our teammates, customers and investors determine how much positive impact we have. So how do we learn to get good at relationships?
For the answer, I turn to surfing. Learning to surf is hard. Catching a wave is very infrequent, so beginners get a minimal chance to practice on a real wave. Good instructors, therefore, have figured out how to get their students lots of practice on the pieces of surfing that don't require an actual wave. 
There are four parts to surfing: paddling, turning, popping up, and riding. It turns out that you can practice the first three without a wave. So, that's what good instructors do. They have their students practice paddling and turning in flat water and practice popping up on land. Once the student masters those skills, they move to a wave. And, not surprisingly, the student then quickly masters catching and riding the wave. 
The same pattern holds for relationships. We don't get that many touchpoints with our teammates, customers, and investors. In turn, it means that each of those touchpoints is high stakes, so we find it difficult to experiment with a new way. We need a method of getting lots of practice doing relationships (touchpoints) in a low-stakes way. Where can we get that?
Do you have children, a significant other, a friend, or a parent? The answer, of course, is yes. Well, then, there is your practice ground. Relationships with humans (teammates, customers, or investors) are no different than relationships with humans (children, spouse, friends, or family members). Get good at your relationship with your spouse or children, and you will discover that you learn all the skills needed to develop a great relationship with your teammates or customers.
If you choose to practice with your spouse, you can:
Ask your spouse if he is interested in learning this with you. (He will say ""Yes!"")
Go on Amazon and choose a book to read and study together (get two copies). Here are some excellent options: 
Hold Me Tight

Take a course. Either in a group over a weekend or 1-1 with the teacher.
Who knew that the best way to learn an essential work skill is first to learn that skill at home?!

"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LLfA6TgDoynzduB-2Xp0XHmMN5lUiRxx8ht3VjYJ0E/edit ,"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)

With the advent of forced remote, many CEOs find that some of their team members are profoundly unhappy. They see this when valued team members choose to leave the 500+ person company and move to another job, most often to an organization with just a few people (early startup or investment firm), or to no job at all. This move often appears illogical. The person is giving up lots of compensation. The CEO often feels personally insulted and undoubtedly confused. 
There is no need to be confused. The reasons are actually logical. 
In this remote world, many people feel disconnected, which leads to sadness, often intense sadness (i.e., depression). Those in this state know that something needs to change, but they are not sure what. Their job is the activity that consumes most of their day, so they often assume the cause lies. They believe that their disconnection comes from the fact that they are working at a ""big company."" If they leave for a small company, they will regain a sense of connection. 
Unfortunately, they rarely do because their disconnection is not coming from the company's size but rather how they are working remotely. 
Most managers feel that they are not allowed to ask about a report's personal life, and therefore are unwilling to ask about the report's home environment and daily routines. This tactic is a mistake. The manager is a coach whose role is to help their report unpack and solve the issues that the report faces, whether they appear in their work or personal world. 
Therefore, as a manager, if you sense that one of your reports is unhappy or experiencing mental/emotional pain, ask them about it. Ask them about their home environment and daily routine. I posit that you will likely discover that they do not do or have at least one of the following:
Get outside
See other people that they know
Exercise
Have access to a consistently uninterrupted space to take Zoom calls
I posit that humans need four things to feel mentally balanced:
Connection to nature
Connection to tribe
Blood flow
Uninterrupted workspace
Pre-COVID, we could each achieve these to some degree simply by going to an office. 
We had to leave our residence each day to get to transportation which brought us to and from the office. By leaving our home, we encountered outside air, even if only briefly, which created a connection to nature.
We saw other people in the office who were familiar to us. They may not have been our best friends, but we knew them. We said hello and goodbye, maybe had lunch with them, perhaps even met for drinks after work, and shared an occasional laugh. This action created a connection to a tribe.
We had to physically walk to transport, which got our bodies moving a little bit and thus our blood flowing a bit. Many of us took advantage of being out by going to the gym and really getting our blood to flow.
The design of the modern office is for performance, with call booths, conference rooms, or private offices for meetings and calls. Thus, we had uninterrupted workspaces.
We achieved these things unwittingly. 
Rather than convince you that these elements create a feeling of peace and satisfaction, I challenge you to experiment with them. 
Naturally, going to an in-person office gave us each of these to a small degree. Suppose we are intentional about creating them in a work-from-home environment. In that case, we can achieve them to a much higher degree, and therefore feel even greater personal satisfaction than we did when going to the office. 
Here is how I do it:
Connection to nature. 
I take a 5-minute walk outside at the beginning of the day before I start work. And I take a 5-minute walk at the end of the day once I have stopped work. 
My walk not only creates a connection to nature by getting me into the outside air, but it also is a nice signal of the transition to and from work. Before the morning and after the evening transition, I do not allow myself to work, leaving me space to focus on family and personal activities. 
I also take breaks regularly throughout the day. I only schedule 25- and 50-minute meetings, and I end all of them on time. This schedule allows me a break to go to do one or more of the following: 
go to the bathroom
get a drink of water
get a snack
get outside
prepare for the next meeting 


When I get outside (which I do at least once every 2 hours), I 
Close my eyes and face the sun (even if it's cloudy) for 1 minute. This moment creates an intense and quick connection to nature.
While doing so, I stretch my hip flexors while taking five deep breaths. This stretch gets my blood flowing.
Then I find my wife or one of my children and give them a 1-minute hug. (Truth be told, only my wife puts up with this. My kids top out at 10 seconds when they are willing to hug me at all.) Hugs create an intense and quick connection to my tribe.
Connection to tribe: 
In addition to the 1-minute hugs mentioned above, I schedule in-person socially-distant gatherings at least once a week. 
I put zero effort into hosting. I am only willing to send an email stating the time and location of the gathering. 
Sometimes it is at an open-air restaurant/bar for a drink or meal. Sometimes it is on my patio where each guest must bring whatever they want to drink or eat. 
My intent is not to be rude but rather to make organizing and hosting incredibly easy for me, increasing the likelihood that I will continue to do so. 
The purpose of these gatherings for me is laughter. I invite those with whom I can generate that laughter. 
Blood flow 
In addition to the short walks at the beginning and end of the day and the 1-minute breaks, I run on the treadmill. But rather than see how much I can do, I have experimented with how little I can do and still get the benefit of a feeling of peace and calm in my body that lasts for more than 24 hours. For me, that time is 3 minutes at 4.0 speed. I run for 5 minutes to be safe. 
Once again, my goal is to make this step so easy (i.e., short and slow) that there is no reason for me not to do it each day. 
I should note that I often skip the morning walk in favor of the 5 minutes on the treadmill because my treadmill is in an unattached garage, so I have to go outside to get to it. Thus, I am getting my connection to nature anyway. 
Uninterrupted workspace 
I have converted a back room into a Zoom studio. It is far from the locus of kids' activities, and I can lock the door so that no one accidentally wanders in. 
Many of your team members do not have a large enough home, or an unused room, to create such an uninterrupted space. The answer for them is either of the following. 
A co-working space outside the home 
Rent a home in a less expensive part of the country to afford a larger space. 
I recommend that the company provide a rent stipend for either a co-work space or a remote residence.
My wife and I have hired a homeschool teacher to be with our children. 
Many of your team members cannot afford to do this on their own. For them, you can: 
Change the culture in the company. Re-frame a child walking into a Zoom call as a welcome introduction of the team member's family to their co-workers. Ask the meeting owner to look forward to these moments to increase team bonding by getting to know each other as humans. 
Do what Gitlab does and create Juicebox Zoom calls that bring families together for remote playdates throughout the day and introduce them to children in many locations that they would otherwise never have access.
Encourage parents to partner with other families to create a micro-school (hire a teacher jointly).
With these steps above, I feel connected, grounded, and peaceful throughout the day. Even when I have back-to-back-to-back Zoom calls throughout the day, I feel energized as long as I actually take a break between each call and get outside during those breaks.
Other things contribute to my sense of well-being. They are:
Desk set-up:
I have a standing desk. Because of it, my neck, back, and body do not get sore or stiff. (Before I had a standing desk, I used a neck pillow with pressure knobs for a few minutes during breaks and at the end of the day to relieve the tension in my neck and back.)
I have placed my desk directly in front of a window. This location achieves two purposes: 
It allows me to look outside at nature throughout the day. I also open the window to allow in fresh air when the weather cooperates. This step gives me a connection to nature.
The natural light on my face is akin to professional video lighting, allowing me to appear fully present during video calls. 
Morning routine:
I follow Tim Ferriss's morning routine suggestion. 
Meditate for 10 minutes (while still in bed) using the Waking Up app.
Journal (while still in bed) using the 5-Minute Journal. 
Make my bed. 
Drink a large glass of water. 
3-minute run on the treadmill.
Every other day, I do push-ups using the Just 6 Weeks app.


This 20 minute routine invigorates me and launches me with energy and clarity into the day's tasks.
Meals:
I try to eat every meal and snack sitting outside with no phone.
Entertainment:
I try (with decent success) not to look at an electronic device for entertainment. This change means that I no longer look at my phone to view news, Twitter, YouTube, etc.


Without electronic entertainment, I force myself to do other activities during non-work times. I end up: 
Sitting outside and staring at the leaves blowing in the wind (intense connection to nature)
Talking with my wife (connection to tribe)
Talking and playing with my kids (connection to tribe)
Reading a paper book (soothing)


These activities bring me a sense of peace, whereas looking at my phone or a screen never does.
Time away:
I do not work at all on the weekends, guaranteeing myself two days of rejuvenation each week. And I take a long weekend with my family once every few months. 


Plaid recently looked at vacation days and found that their team members weren't taking them … at all. So, Plaid scheduled two 4-day weekends for 2H20. During these long weekends, no one at Plaid is allowed to work. (Of course, Plaid can't stop the sales team from responding to emails. But hopefully, they will be doing so from a lovely location.)


I recommend that you do the same.
Please think of these suggestions as experiments. There are many other ways to connect to nature, connection to tribe, blood flow, and uninterrupted workspace. 
Find the ways that work for you. Make sure that you do them every day and several times each day. 
And as a Manager, make sure that your reports are doing so as well. If you do, I posit that you and your team members will retain a lasting sense of connection, peace, and well-being. And your team members will therefore stay with the company.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
""While it is often worth digging into someone's personal life, be aware that there is a risk, and this is not a universal positive. Some people will feel offended if you pressure them to reveal personal details. Instead, invite the conversation if people accept, great. If not, that's fine too.
I'm not sure that I buy that people get connected to nature by taking an Uber. But I agree that it is critical to avoid the claustrophobia of staying indoors for days. 
The recommendations above are very specific. They are one way to be happy. There are many other ways. 
One minute is a long time for a hug!
We need to update this process for a post-COVID world.”

Remote:  Gitlab’s Guide to All-Remote (a while),https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/ ,"GitLab's Guide to All-Remote
How to work remotely - the GitLab guide
GitLab is one of the world’s largest all-remote companies with over 1,500 team members located in more than 65 countries around the world.

Our all-remote workforce implementation is featured in The Journal of Organizational Design. It is also the centerpiece of case studies authored by Harvard Business School and INSEAD.

On this page and subpages, we’ll share what “all-remote” really means, how it works at GitLab, some tips and tricks for remote teams, and resources to learn more.

The Remote Manifesto
All-remote work promotes:

Hiring and working from all over the world (instead of from a central location).
Flexible working hours (over set working hours).
Writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations).
Written processes (over on-the-job training).
Public sharing of information (over need-to-know access).
Opening up documents for editing by anyone (over top-down control of documents).
Asynchronous communication (over synchronous communication).
The results of work (over the hours put in).
Formal communication channels (over informal communication channels).
Why remote?

“Remote is not a challenge to overcome. It’s a clear business advantage.” -Victor, Product Manager, GitLab

From the cost savings on office space to more flexibility in employees’ daily lives, all-remote work offers a number of advantages to organizations and their people.

But we also recognize that being part of an all-remote company isn’t for everyone. Here’s a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.

Our long-term vision for remote work

GitLab pioneers the ‘Head of Remote’ role
By hiring a Head of Remote in 2019, GitLab triggered a global movement of appointing a dedicated leader to evolve a company’s remote fluency.

This page details the backstory of the movement’s origins, explains what a Head of Remote is, provides job description templates, and open source certifications to enhance your markability as a remote work leader.

Being a great remote manager
Many traits found in superb remote managers are also found in managers of colocated teams, though there are nuances to serving, leading, and guiding when managing teams that you do not see in-person each day.

Learn what it takes to be a great remote manager.

People
All-remote organizations tend to attract people who place a high degree of value on autonomy, flexibility, empathy, and mobility. It also presents outsized opportunity for people who must live or prefer to live in rural areas, where well-paying careers in technical industries are few and far between.

Learn more about the types of people who are adopting a remote lifestyle.

Values
While all-remote isn’t a value itself, it’s something we do in order to practice our values.

Learn how a collection of values at GitLab contributes to a thriving all-remote environment.

Building and reinforcing a sustainable culture
Culture is best defined not by how a company or team acts when all is well; rather, by the behaviors shown during times of crisis or duress.

Forcing functions to work remote-first
Whether it’s unwinding from offices entirely and going all-remote, or attempting to create a level playing field for in-office and remote team members in a hybrid-remote arrangement, leaders should consider key forcing functions to ensure a commitment to remote-first practices.

Learn more about tactical, actionable steps that will send a clear message that leadership is serious about implementing remote in the organization.

Collaboration and whiteboarding with remote teams
“How do you collaborate and whiteboard in a remote environment?” is a frequently asked question. In a colocated setting, collaboration often happens face-to-face with a whiteboard on hand in a conference room. Working remotely sometimes feels like working on your own, with your own calendar, and your own schedule. With a common goal, strategic planning, and the right collaboration tools, working in a remote environment can be even more productive than working in an office.

Learn more about collaboration and whiteboarding in remote work environments.

Remote onboarding
Onboarding remotely should focus on three key dimensions: the organizational, the technical, and the social. By using this integrated approach, top companies enable their employees to stay and thrive in their roles. We’ll show how you can focus on these three key dimensions of onboarding through an all-remote onboarding process.

We’ve also compiled a list of companies that have been inspired by GitLab’s culture.

Hiring
GitLab envisions a world where talented, driven individuals can find roles and seek employment based on business needs, rather than an oftentimes arbitrary location.

Hiring across the globe isn’t without its challenges. There are local regulations and risks unique to countries and regions around the globe. We believe that these challenges are worth overcoming, and opening our talent acquisition pipeline beyond the usual job centers creates a competitive advantage. We hope to see this advantage wane as more all-remote companies are created.

Learn more about hiring in an all-remote environment.

Compensation
While there are certain complexities to paying team members who are spread out in over 50 countries, we believe that it’s worthwhile. Being an all-remote company enables us to hire the world’s best talent, not just the best talent from a few cities.

Learn more about compensation in an all-remote environment.

Learning and Development
We believe that all-remote companies are at a competitive advantage when it comes to educating and developing team members.

Learn more on how to make learning and development a companywide mindset in an all-remote environment.

Self-service
It’s not what you know. It’s knowing where to look. This is true at GitLab and other organizations that are intentional about documenting processes, and it is entirely counter to how typical work environments are structured.

Learn more about the importance of self-searching, self-learning, and self-service in an all-remote organization.

Informal Communication
In an all-remote environment, informal communication should be formally addressed. Leaders should organize informal communication, and to whatever degree possible, design an atmosphere where team members all over the globe feel comfortable reaching out to anyone to converse about topics unrelated to work.

Learn more about enabling informal communication in an all-remote company.

Asynchronous communication
In an all-remote setting, where team members are empowered to live and work where they’re most fulfilled, mastering asynchronous workflows is vital to avoiding dysfunction and enjoying outsized efficiencies. Increasingly, operating asynchronously is necessary even in colocated companies which have team members on various floors or offices, especially when multiple time zones are involved.

Learn more about implementing asynchronous workflows in your organization, and the benefits to both employee and employer.

Handbook-first documentation
A handbook-first organization is home to team members who benefit from having a single source of truth to lean on. This type of organization is able to operate with almost supernatural efficiency. An organization that does not put concerted effort into documenting has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers.

Learn more about the significance of handbook-first documentation.

Meetings
Learn how to decide when a meeting is necessary and how to optimize them in an all-remote environment.

Communicating effectively and responsibly through text
Embracing text communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and vocalized communiques are the norm.

Learn more about mastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting.

In-person interactions
While there are tremendous advantages to operating a 100% remote company, leaders should consider being intentional about planning in-person elements, even if they’re optional for team members.

Learn more about considerations for in-person interactions in a remote company.

Workspace
All-remote enables the creation of a custom office, perfectly tailored for your desires and ergonomic needs.

Learn more about key considerations when building and evolving your remote workspace.

Parenting as a remote worker
Parents who work from home have unique demands and expectations, as well as unique challenges. Being an excellent coworker and an excellent parent is a tall order, particularly when childcare and school are impacted by a global crisis.

Learn more about balancing remote work and parenting.

Stories
Read the stories of some of our team members and hear how remote work has impacted their lives.

Interviews
Read and listen to interviews on the topic of working remotely, hosted by GitLab team members.

History
Learn about historical milestones, inflection points, and prescient interviews in the evolution and expansion of remote work.

Hybrid-remote
Hybrid-remote companies have one or more offices where a subset of the company commutes to each day, paired with a subset of the company that works remotely.

Learn more about advantages, challenges, and the primary differences between all-remote and other forms of remote working.

Comparing All-Remote Benefits vs. Hybrid-Remote Benefits

Transitioning or adding remote
Learn more about considerations for transitioning a colocated or hybrid-remote company to 100% remote.

What not to do when implementing remote
An organization should not attempt to merely replicate the in-office/colocated experience, remotely.

Learn more about what not to do when transitioning to remote, or moving towards remote.

Working while traveling
Working remotely enables a tremendous amount of freedom, enabling team members to work from anywhere so long as there is a reliable internet connection.

Learn more about optimizing comfort and efficiency when taking your office with you while traveling.

Remote work conferences, summits, and events
Particularly for those who are seeking a new role with an all-remote or remote-first company, events can be a great place to meet others who have experience and connections in the space.

Learn more about remote work conferences and summits, the power of networking, and the unique elements of experiencing a virtual event.

Remote internships
Remote internships are unique in one primary way: there is no physical office involved.

Learn more about considerations for both employee and employer as it relates to remote internships (also referred to as apprenticeships and co-ops).

All-remote Certification
GitLab is a pioneer in the all-remote space. As one of the world’s largest all-remote companies, we have developed a custom certification program to test and apply knowledge attained throughout the all-remote section of the handbook. Emerging leaders must quickly learn and deploy remote-first practices and skills while expanding their knowledge of remote management and overall remote fluency.","GitLab's extensive guide covers all aspects of all-remote work, from advantages and disadvantages to management tips and remote collaboration strategies."
Responding to Negative Reviews by Faith Meyer (4 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRgQZuHJYKx_G1ggJObwidnHn6jQWAJ81IEUT2W9HTk/edit?usp=sharing ,"Responding to Negative Reviews by Faith Meyer (4 min)

Negative reviews are a gift — if you choose to see them that way.

DO NOT REPLY right away — especially if you are in any heightened emotional state. 

Instead, pause and let yourself acknowledge all the stress, rage, shame, and other not-so-pleasant emotions and feelings that may arise after being confronted with an irate (and often anonymous) review. 

Just allow yourself to experience, label and process whatever feelings are coming up for you. Then, walk away until you’re clear-headed and in a grounded state.

Once you’ve taken the time you need to process, ask yourself the following questions:


What gift(s) are they giving me with their feedback, however harsh it may be? 
What can I learn from this? What gaps in our processes/approach/product are they helping me see?
Is there 5% or even 1% (or more) of what they’ve written that you can agree with/validate as being true?

Then, to lay the foundation for responding, consider this:

People don’t trust organizations that only have 5 star reviews. If organizations have at least one negative review, people are far more likely to trust the business’ online reputation.
All emotions aside, this is an opportunity to show publicly who you and your business are at your core. What do you want people to see? What you believe and embody will come through.
You have an opportunity to make them feel heard — even if you don’t agree with what they’ve shared. Organizations’ and leaders’ abilities to do this well is PRICELESS. 

That in mind, follow these steps as you draft your response.


Ensure your intention is crystal clear and in alignment with your values.
Thank the person — for the gift of their feedback, for taking the time to share this, whatever feels like genuine gratitude to you.
Validate their experience by repeating back what you “heard”/what they shared with you. If there are opportunities for you to take ownership or offer an apology that’s warranted, do so.
Ask for their permission to speak with you (or whoever posts the response) to make amends and provide your contact info — especially if they wrote their review anonymously. This gesture is important as it’s a way to show that you genuinely care about them and their experience with your organization. 
Close sincerely — either by reiterating your appreciation or in a way that’s in alignment with who you are as an org.
Walk away. Give yourself a break. Re-read it from a clear-headed standpoint, and ask someone else to proof it/check it against your goals before posting it if possible.

Real Life Examples:
I know firsthand how confronting bad reviews can be, especially when you’ve poured everything into building your business from the ground up. The bootstrapped startup I ran in NYC (first as COO and then CEO) experienced its fair share as we dared greatly (and erred plenty). 

Here are two real life examples from our startup, Med School Tutors, which was acquired in 2021. The first (and I think the best) is from our former CEO, Robert, who was exceptional at this and who started our team down this path of genuine and wholehearted responses to negative reviews. 

The second was one of my early attempts at applying this methodology; I had not fully shifted out of anger, and you can feel the defensiveness in my response. 
Example 1:

Example 2:

Restoration and Creativity:  how to achieve them (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUU3WVCsXKBLx0IUZoz9K939khuDV5VUD7grBgJ5Wis/edit ,"Restoration and Creativity:  how to achieve them (3 min)
Most CEOs that I coach, when I first meet them, are working 14 hour days. If they have a spouse and children, they then spend another few hours connecting with them. The rest of the time, they sleep but never enough. 
The obvious cost of this lifestyle is that it leaves little if any time for the brain to turn off and restore. 
The unobvious cost is that the brain is not fully creative (or creative at all) when it has no time to be distraction-free.
All CEOs need mental rest. And all of them need to be creative to envision (and document) the future of their product or service.
So, how do you get mental rest and become creative while also working 14 hours a day?
The answer is: find ways to get bored. Small ways and big ways. 
Let me explain.
We are naturally in a mentally restorative and creative state until we introduce distractions. And modern life is nothing but distractions, both work and pleasure. On the work side: responding to messages, being in meetings, etc. On the pleasure side: watching videos or social media posts. All give us small hits of adrenaline, which temporarily feel good.  But they also put our brains in alert status (amygdala) to see what comes next, with no capacity for creative thought. And the constant adrenaline doesn't allow our minds to rest and restore. 
When we remove these distractions, we at first feel bored (for some people this feeling is almost unbearable).  But if we allow ourselves to sit with this state and simply let it be, then eventually we start to feel a sense of mental relaxation.  And then our creative thoughts begin to flow.
To achieve this state, we truly need to experience NO DISTRACTIONS. That means turning off all sources of distraction. Certainly all electronic sources (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.). As well as all inbound requests for information: email, text, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.
You can do this for a few minutes (whenever you use the restroom), 30-60 minutes (when you have a meal), two days (the weekend), or a week (a restorative vacation or staycation).
All of these have value. The key to each is allowing yourself to get bored. And in the beginning, you won't enjoy it. You are physically addicted to distraction and the adrenaline that it delivers. Give yourself time to get unaddicted. On the other side, you will find restoration and creativity. 
Start with something small. Simply delete your social media apps, and commit to putting your phone away (in another room) whenever you are using the restroom, eating, or drinking. During that time, simply sit with your thoughts. Take your food and beverages outside if you can (to eliminate further the distraction of seeing your workspace). Stare at the leaves swaying in the wind while you eat and drink. 
Try this for 30 days. It is a low-cost experiment, as you aren't getting real work done when eating, drinking, and using the restroom anyway. See if you feel more or less restored and creative than you did in the previous 30 days.
If you feel more so, then step up your experimentation and try longer stints distraction-free. Try an entire weekend disconnected. If that feels good (and it will!), then schedule an entire week disconnected. And if that feels good, then make all of this a regular practice. Put it on your calendar.
All meals entirely disconnected.
One weekend a month entirely disconnected. 
One week a quarter entirely disconnected.
That investment alone will reap huge rewards for your mental peace and the company's ability to see the future.

This works for artistic creativity as well. I once coached a well-known musician. He came to me because he needed to write the songs for his new album, but no creativity would flow. He would go into the studio each afternoon after a day of meetings and responding to emails. He couldn't quiet his mind from the day's activities, so he started taking a few stiff drinks. This action calmed his mind a bit, but not enough. And the drinks were starting to take a toll on his body. What to do?
The answer: we simply applied the philosophy above. We arranged for him to rent a studio in another part of the country (where no one would know where to find him) for ten days, turn off all messaging and entertainment apps, have with him only the key people he needed to function (i.e., to get food and drink, collaborate on the music production, etc.), no drugs or alcohol, and allow himself to simply get bored. 
He called me after the ten days and said: ""Matt, it was incredible. I was more creative than I've ever been. I wrote and recorded the best songs of my life, and I know this album will be a huge hit. I cannot thank you enough. In hindsight, it makes so much sense. Every artist should be doing this.""
The album has now been released.  It is indeed a hit.

“This is a game-changer.  I call it Stillness.  I just sit doing nothing and let my monkey mind go everywhere.  At the beginning the monkey is crazy.  Then the monkey starts slowing down, and clarity comes.  When I am on vacation, I make sure to do Stillness at least 1 hour per day.  Stillness is the vacation.  And now I am forcing myself to do at least 10 minutes per day when I am working.  In the first minutes, I keep moving my arm to grab my phone.  But eventually my mind stills, and I feel peace.  It is a game-changer.”

You’ve built a product for enterprises (B2B).  As founder, you have been able to sell the product.  Now you’ve hired several salespeople, but one or all of them have not yet closed a deal on their own.  And they don’t seem capable of doing so.  What to do?

No need to worry.  Like most business problems, this one has been solved many times before.  Here is one way …

Selling to the enterprise is a complex process.  It requires understanding the customer and their problem as well as your solution and its applications.  Some of this can be documented in writing (and therefore learned by new salespeople in a traditional onboarding process), but not all of it.  To understand the entire process, new salespeople must …

Shadow another successful salesperson (ie- at first, that is you, the CEO) going through the entire sales process from start to finish


Document what they saw


Have the successful salesperson reverse shadow the new salesperson and give them feedback … until the new salesperson both succeeds (ie- by making a sale) and is approved by the successful salesperson (this is a higher bar than making one sale)


This is usually painful for the successful salesperson to do.  They often don’t want to “waste” their time this way.  Unfortunately, this is a crucial step and must be done.


Teach another new salesperson the entire process using the previous 3 steps

As CEO, you will have to train the first hired salesperson this way. Then they have to train the next few salespeople this way.  Etc.
","To scale enterprise sales, CEO must personally train salespeople, have them shadow successful salesperson, and provide feedback until they succeed."

Some sort of sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful.  I’ve found the only thing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I really like the Emfit QS+Active.

I like a cold, dark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on a great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my sleep quality.  I love this one).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep helps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though I’m not willing to do that all the time.

I use a Chili Pad to be cold while I sleep if I can’t get the room cold enough, which is great but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room).
When traveling, I use an eye mask and ear plugs.

This is likely to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep.  I am a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.  It likely has trade- offs, but so does not sleeping well.  If you can already sleep well, I wouldn’t recommend this.

I use a full spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on email.  It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d try.  It’s a ridiculous gain for me.  I like this one, and it’s easy to travel with.

Exercise is probably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of different exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best was lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval training occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also the exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.  
The third area is nutrition.  I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of fasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up).  I know this is contrary to most advice, and I suspect it’s not optimal for most people, but it definitely works well for me.

Eating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don’t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house.

I have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch.  I assume this is about 200mg total of caffeine per day.  I tried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.  I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if I’m super tired and really need to get something done.

Saying Goodbye to a Teammate (2 min) (Trishia Pasaquian),https://www.notion.so/mocharymethod/Saying-Goodbye-to-a-Teammate-c256b6c72f7c463f8ec586dd58c3b535 ,"# Saying Goodbye to a Teammate

<aside>
👋🏼 *Saying goodbye to a teammate is never easy. Whether it’s due to a teammate leaving for another job, retirement, or any other circumstance — saying farewell can be difficult and emotional.*

*It’s natural for those of us who have worked closely with someone over the years to feel a sense of loss when they are no longer part of our team.*

</aside>

### There are a few things to keep in mind when saying goodbye to a teammate:

### 👉🏼 **It is important to be respectful and to be understanding that this person is leaving - whether they’re leaving on their own accord or being let go.**

### 👉🏼 **If the person is being let go and you’ve already informed them of your decision (in 1:1), as a manager, give them some time to process the news and process their emotions.**

- Hearing this news can be devastating emotionally and financially for the person being let go. **It’s important to hold a safe space for the person to digest the news and first, process their fear or anger, or sadness, and then let them shift out of it.**
    - The time varies for everyone but it usually takes a day or two for them to really process.

### 👉🏼 **Bi-directionality is crucial when someone is leaving the team.**

- **Notify the team the same day that the person finds out - their end date, so it’s not a surprise to the team.** State the reason, to an extent that’s appropriate  - do not disclose private information.
    - The best thing is for the employment to end the same day as the person finds out they no longer have a job at MM. Having them stay after that point is not healthy for anyone. So, the person's last day is the day that they get the news. This should also be the day that the rest of the team gets the news as well.
- **Let the teammate announce the news themselves in the [#team-announcements](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C01AGLFTLKD) channel in Slack.**
    - Encourage them to give their farewells, leave their contact information, and tell the what they’re was up to next.

### 👉🏼 E**xpress gratitude for the time spent together.** There are a few ways to do this:

- **Block a time, say 10mins, in an all-hands meeting or the closest team meeting for everyone to celebrate the person** by:
    - Thank them for their contributions.
    - Acknowledge what they will be missed most of.
    - Offer well-wishes for their future endeavors.
- **Have a farewell lunch or happy hour.** If location and time permits, it can be valuable to hold an in-person gathering to eat out with the team to celebrate the person.
- If a sync meeting is not possible due to distributed time zones, you can opt to:
    1. **Write a farewell card or email where the team can share their love and appreciation for the person.** The manager can organize this and send it on their last day. That way, everyone starts humble and leaves grateful.
        - It could be in a message format or people can send a screenshot of what most represents the person leaving in their mind. Examples of this would be a slack message, a photo, a meme, work output, etc. These can be organized into a digital card/board.
    2. **This could also be in a video format.** People can individually record a loom/video celebrating the teammate and combine it as a company farewell with good wishes.
    3. **Send them off with a farewell gift (e.g. gift card, gift basket, etc.) as a token of appreciation for all they have done.**

### 👉🏼 Offer support if they need help transitioning into their new role or team.

- **Add the teammate to [#z-mm-alumni](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C04B8G1U9BM) (Mochary Method Alumni Channel) on Slack.** This is a quick and efficient way to stay in touch and check in with them from time to time.
- **Connecting on LinkedIn** will help you stay in touch after they leave so you can remain updated on each other's progressions throughout your careers—and even if there isn't an opportunity now, staying connected may lead to something great down the road!

### 👉🏼 Make sure that the team doesn't neglect themselves during these tough times.

- **Offer to do quick 1:1s with teammates individually** to hold space for them to talk about how they’re feeling about this person leaving, ask questions they might have, and make them feel heard and understood.","Saying goodbye to a departing teammate involves respect, understanding, gratitude, and support. Communication, celebration, and connection are key elements in the farewell process."
Scale or not to Scale? (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEH0EWZOXu0nptlOCXM9etBiLVO2qDWuS_JIwK7go9w/edit ,"Scale or not to Scale? (2 min)
If you are a startup in Silicon Valley and have discovered a large potential market, you will raise significant capital early. This will allow you to hire many people. Investors may well pressure you to do so to ""win the race to market share."" Resist this pressure. It is misplaced. 
Startups don't usually fail because they grow too late. They typically fail because they grow too early (i.e., before achieving Product Market Fit). 
Product-Market Fit
What is Product-Market Fit? I define it as having created a product that customers are finding so much value in that they are willing to buy it (after their test phase) and recommend it. Metrics that show whether PMF has been achieved include: revenue, renewal rates, NPS (net promoter score). 
The company's first goal should be to achieve real PMF, not metrics that fool people inside and outside the company that PMF has been achieved. 
For a B2B company, know that enterprise customers have budgets just for testing new technology and will buy your product to do just that. This does not mean that you have achieved PMF. For these types of customers, only long-term contracts are an indication that they value your product and want to use it.
There is no magic metric, but for a B2B company, it's hard to imagine PMF at anything less than $1mm ARR.
Scaling
Once you have achieved Product-Market Fit, that is the right time to blitz scale and win the race to market share. To do this, you will need to create massive awareness (Marketing), walk many customers through the sales process (Sales), hold those customers hands as they set up and use your product or service (Customer Success), harden your infrastructure to withstand many users at once (DevOps), get rid of technical debt as well as add all the features promised in your roadmap (Engineering), update the product roadmap to meet the most urgent needs of your customers (Product), and all of the non-technical operations (People [Recruiting, Training, and HR], Finance, Legal, Office). All of this requires hiring talented and experienced people to fulfill those functions. First, raise the money needed to hire this team, and then begin hiring. 
Once you bring on remote workers and your team scales beyond 15-20 people, most likely, things will begin to fall apart. You will hire very talented people, and they simply won't perform in the way you hope or expect. You will end up doing more and more work yourself, working longer and longer hours, just to keep the company afloat. You will extrapolate this trend and realize that soon you will break. 

It is at that moment that you need to implement a formal management system. It will be painful. You will no longer be able to just ""work on the product."" You and your team will likely have to spend one full day per week preparing for and participating in team and one-on-one meetings. These meetings and this system will feel like pure overhead. They are. And without them, your company will never scale successfully. 
The good news is that the same system that allows your company to operate well with 25 people will also work well with 25,000. Neither the system nor the amount of overhead will change. It is a one-time hit.
The rest of this book walks through the implementation of such a system.",Startups should focus on achieving Product-Market Fit before scaling. Scaling requires hiring experienced teams and implementing formal management systems.
Scaling:  Hire a “Manager Trainer” as COO (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtLurYDKUXqy2VHFWcw027sJhHPCwsatV2GaVF4jebk/edit ,"Scaling:  Hire a “Manager Trainer” as COO (3 min)

One of the most dangerous transitions a company makes is from less than twenty team members to more than forty. During this time, communication and productivity usually break down. The system of group organization that existed when the company was all sitting in the same room together (no system at all) suddenly no longer works when team members are not all sitting next to each other. Once your company has over 40 team members, you will hire great people, but they won't know what to do, and you will be frustrated by their lack of output. 
Luckily, there is an answer. It has a time cost. But once you implement it, it will allow your company to become productive again and will continue to be effective as your company scales from 10s of team members to 100s to 1,000s to 10,000s.
Every successful large technology company uses this system. It has no single name—Google, for example, calls theirs ""Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)""—but the systems are essentially the same from company to company. They share the following key functions:
Setting vision and goals for the company, each department, and each individual regularly (usually quarterly).
Communicating that vision and those goals to every team member.
Tracking and reporting progress toward those goals on a regular timetable (usually weekly or bi-weekly).
Eliciting feedback from all team members on what is going right and (much more importantly) what is not going right and needs to be changed.
The system streamlines and organizes: 
information flow out, so the CEO can inform team members of the company priorities,
Information flow in, so team members can provide feedback to the CEO about what is and isn't working.
This information exchange takes place through a deliberate series of goal-oriented meetings, which comprise the system's core.
In my experience, it is effortless to copy this system if you see it in operation. But it isn't easy to implement such a system by reading instructions (including these). When you get to this point in your company's life cycle, I recommend doing one of two things:
Hire a COO who was a manager at a large, well-managed company (over 200 employees) to implement and run this system for you. (Ideally, Google, Facebook, or Amazon, as these companies have excellent management training programs.)


Hire an x-CEO to come in as a ""1 day a week CEO"" to implement this system. She should be able to do so in 8-12 weeks. Have her then watch you run the system for two weeks to ensure that you are doing it correctly. Then run it yourself going forward.

One of the measures you have successfully implemented this system is that your original team members continue to perform as excellent managers even as their departments grow massively. If there is no system, then you will be forced to hire ever-more-experienced managers who will layer over your original team members. When that happens, a tremendous amount of institutional knowledge is lost, and ultimately the company can never perform as well. 
This dichotomy is apparent when looking at NBA teams. The Golden State Warriors were an underperforming team under Mark Jackson in 2013-14. Once Steve Kerr joined in 2014-15 and brought an effective system, the same roster of players became dominant and won the championship. (Yes, they brought in Kevin Durant, but that was only later.) By contrast, the Cleveland Cavaliers (with Lebron James) and Houston Rockets (with James Harden) had no system and simply relied on individual talent. Even against remarkable talent, the system inevitably wins.
The dichotomy can be seen in companies as well. Many members of Facebook's original leadership team continue to be on the leadership team today. This is because Sheryl brought a management system to the company that elevated all who used it. By contrast, Twitter has not developed a similarly effective system. Instead, they have hired individual superstars. And while the people at Twitter are remarkably talented, the company as a whole does not function nearly as well as Facebook.  ",Implement system like OKRs for company growth. Hire experienced COO from large company or x-CEO to set up and oversee.
Selling (6 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6fnyDDqdzAFdzJzZkiAnaKvZzjzkX5HSwAjuedvlQQ/edit# ,"Selling (6 min)

When I decide what product to buy, what service provider to hire, what company to join, what company to invest in, and what investor money to take, I most often decide based on how much I like the person presenting the option to me. And how much I like a person depends entirely on how much personal connection has been created between us. 
Does this person care about me? Do they respect me? Are they curious about me as a human? Do they ask about my life, my likes/dislikes, etc.? Do they then truly listen when I share that information with them? And do they act based on what I share with them?
I am not unique in this behavior.
So, when you are selling something, how can you make people like you?
Here are some things that have worked for me.
Get introduced by someone I already trust and like
Find someone that you know (preferably several) that I already know and like. Have them introduce and recommend you. 
Reach out to me directly
When we do get connected, always reach out to me directly. This sends the message: ""You matter to me."" 
Never have your EA or COS reach out to me on your behalf. That sends the message: ""My time is too valuable for me to interact directly with you."" It's an immediate turn-off.
Remember the famous story about Bill Gates and Frank Gehry, the foremost American architect of his day. Gates very much wanted Gehry to design his (Bill's) house, so Gates had his assistant reach out to Gehry. Gehry declined. Years later, Gates and Gehry happened to meet at an event. Gates asked Gehry, ""Why did you say no to designing my house?"" Gehry replied, ""You never asked me."" Gates said, ""Of course I did."" Gehry replied again, ""No, you never asked me.""
Be highly responsive 24/7
Sam Altman (who ran YC for many years), Sequoia Capital partners, and Goldman Sachs bankers all have this in common: No matter what day of the week, or time of day (other than the sleeping hours), if I reach out to them, they will likely respond to me within 30-60 minutes. The response will be super-brief, but it will let me know that they have received my message and what they will do about it. The messages are rarely more than 1-2 sentences and almost always voice-dictated into a mobile phone (errors and all). 

I value the attentiveness and quick response far more than I would a lengthy response that comes days (or even hours) later. I don't need, nor want, a lengthy response. I just want to know what the next steps are so that I can move on to those next steps. A quick response allows me to keep moving. A slow response slows me down.
Therefore, a quick and short response makes me feel super-attended to. And I am not alone. Most people react this way.
Be highly respectful of my time.
If we make an appointment with each other, please let me know if you will be even one minute late. I don't mind if you are late. I just care if you knew you were going to be late and didn't let me know. 
Once again, Sam Altman, Sequoia Capital partners, and Goldman Sachs bankers all have this in common: When they make an appointment with me, they always give me a heads-up if they will be even one minute late. And I feel cared for each time they do.
Show that you care about me as a human
Yes, we are doing business. But if it's just business, then I feel as though I am a transaction to you. This makes me feel that you are only looking out for your interests, not mine. And this puts me on alert. I have too many things going on in my life to want to add a relationship where I constantly need to audit whether you treat me fairly. If I add another relationship, it will only be one where I trust you and believe that you are looking after my interests so that I never have to audit you. 
If you get curious about me (ask me what I like and dislike, what makes me feel joy/excitement and anger/fear) and then prove to me that you actually listened by referring back to what I said later in the same conversation or a future conversation, then I tell myself that you care about me and will look out for my interest as well as yours. This may be a complete falsehood, but I tell it to myself anyway. And, once again, I am not alone in feeling this way. Most people do.
So, give me what I want. Get curious about me, my family, my dreams and passions (both inside and outside of work), my frustrations and fears (again in and out of work). Once you know what matters to me, I have faith that you can help me. 
Show me (over and over again) that you are thinking about me as a human
Now that you know about me as a human (my spouse's and kids' names, my favorite sports teams, my hobbies, my hopes, and dreams, etc.), the next time we see each other or talk, start that conversation by asking about one of these personal things. I.e., ""Before we get into business, I'd love to hear how your kids George and Anne are doing?""

Then, between our meetings, take the time to reach out to me and let me know that you're thinking of me. 
If I like tennis, send me a text saying, ""I saw this great article on Serena Williams. I know that you love tennis, so it made me think of you.""
On my birthday, send me a message of well wishes. 
Send me a gift that is highly customized and based on the interests you know about me. Not something expensive. Just something that relates to something that you know that I am interested in. 
Ideally, make the gift something that I will see and use each day. Then I will be positively reminded of you each time that I see or use it. The two best such gifts that I have received: 
The briefcase that I use every day.
An Oura ring that I wear every day.
Not coincidentally, both of those gifts were given to me by Brazilians. If you want to take the Master Class, watch a Brazilian operate. They can't explain why they are doing each thing, but it has been infused into them since childhood. They just really like and care about other people. And it shows!
If you want to go to the advanced level (recommended when trying to recruit a high-level exec), reach out to their spouse. Do all of the above with him or her.
This level may seem forced. It's not. Whenever I am recruiting someone, I tell them, ""I imagine that your spouse has concerns about you taking this role. I want him to know that he's got a direct line to me to have those concerns addressed. Would you be open to connecting me to him?"" 
I have never had anyone say ""No."" And each time I have connected directly with the spouse, I have always landed the candidate.
I recommend blocking off one hour per week to reach out and create touchpoints with each important person in your life. You don't have to ping every person every week. But reserve the time to ping as many as you can.
Create A/B Tests
All of the above will feel unnatural to you. You will think that if you start doing it, then the recipient will view the behavior as ""forced and unnatural"" and creepy even. I assure you, they won't. But you need to prove this to yourself. 
So, create an A/B Test. Pick someone you can afford not to succeed with (a customer, partner, investor, or recruit), and try this entire technique. See if the results are positive or not. If not, the cost to you will be low. 
But I posit that the results will be massively positive. And if they are, then you have just learned the art of sales.


APPENDIX:
Be Prepared
Once you are timely and have shown that you care about me as a human, I like you. Now it's time to do all the traditional Sales 101 stuff.
The first is to be prepared. Before each meeting that we have, study up on me so that you know the basics of my situation, company, industry, etc., without me having to tell you.
Discover my problem
Ask what challenge or frustration I am facing and what my goal is. 
Acknowledge my situation
Repeat back my challenge or frustration to me to prove that you actually understood it. Keep summarizing what I said until I say, ""That's right.""   For more detail, see:  Heard:  how to make people feel it (5 min)
(This is the most critical step in the whole process!!! Whenever I encounter someone who does this to me, I always compliment them. Even though I know the technique, I still want to experience it.)
Share your solution
Once I say, ""That's right, "" then explain your solution or pitch to me and how it solves my problem.","Building a personal connection is crucial in sales. Be genuine, responsive, respectful, and show you care about the person you're selling to."
Sleep (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYbZ_g59ZveqVvkrq-796Vj3xUGq0_5kPguUEqIaY1M/edit ,"Sleep (3 min)
Many CEOs that I coach find that they sleep far less now than they did before running a company. For some, that means waking up in the middle of the night thinking about an issue or a to-do. For others, that means going to sleep late (to finish emails, etc.) and then being woken up by the alarm clock to make it to their first meeting. Either way, the elusive ""full night of sleep"" becomes a distant memory. These CEOs feel that their bodies are wearing down, and soon they will break in some way.
If this is happening to you, here are the essential things to know:
This feeling is totally normal!!! There is nothing wrong with you. 
Your body is remarkably resilient. It will not break so easily. (I regularly get between 3 to 6 hours of sleep each night and am fine.)
Your body goes through a sleep cycle of light sleep, deep REM sleep, and lighter sleep again. These cycles usually last 1.5 hours each. What makes us feel tired and groggy is being suddenly woken from a deep sleep, and this almost only happens from an alarm clock. Curiously, we feel better rested with 6 hours of sleep (waking while we are ending a sleep cycle) than we do sleeping for 7 hours, and having an alarm wake us out of REM sleep. (For this reason, I have gone for months with 3 or 4.5 hours of sleep per night and felt just fine.) To test this phenomenon, download a SleepCycle app and use it to both track your sleep patterns and wake during light sleep. If nothing else, you will realize that what you are experiencing is common and not abnormal.
If you are waking with a thought about an issue or a to-do, it is because your mind is desperately trying not to forget this urgent task. To quickly quiet your mind: 
Keep a notepad by your bed. Write down whatever it is that you woke up thinking. In the morning, transfer it to your GTD system.
Faithfully follow your GTD method during the day. Write down all of your next actions, waiting-fors, etc. Your mind will not need to remember this task or issue at night, knowing that you have already recorded it in your GTD system.
When you do wake during the night, don't fight it. Allow yourself to do productive work. If you aren't motivated to do productive work, do something soothing, like reading from a paper book. Avoid doing something unproductive and stimulating (i.e., social media on a screen). Screens emit blue light akin to sunlight and turn the body's circadian rhythm receptors to ""wake"" mode. Therefore, do not turn to a screen in the middle of the night if you can at all avoid it. Enable the habit of no screens by not allowing your phone or computer to even enter your bedroom.
Remember that Benjamin Franklin famously woke up each night after several hours (probably 4.5), took a bath, wrote (which is why he was such a prolific author), and then went back to sleep for several more hours until the sun rose.
Experiment with your sleeping arrangement. Throw money at the problem. Here are some things that have worked for others to create a soothing sleeping environment: 
Sleep position 
Face-down with one leg raised at a 90-degree angle (Tim Feriss).
On the side, with a thick pillow between the legs, a thick pillow that elevates the head until the spine is straight, and a thick pillow to hug, all on a memory-foam bed.
Sleep surface 
Memory-foam bed
Bio-mat
The room 
No phone or screens in the bedroom
Black-out shades
White noise machine, or soothing music
Rituals 
Meditate for several minutes just before going to bed (or in bed)
Orgasm (yes, it helps!)
Sam Altman on sleep, exercise, and nutrition
Timing 
Set the alarm for when to ""go to sleep,"" not one for when to wake up.","CEOs struggle with sleep due to work stress. Tips include understanding sleep cycles, using a GTD system, and optimizing sleep environment."
Star performers:  How to keep them engaged and motivated (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URb0E9CR2ZeUZ2aTRYcrKb7zbIL0ica8HEYy5CKL3lU/edit ,"Star performers:  How to keep them engaged and motivated (2 min)
As your company grows, you will experience regrettable attrition. Some people that you value deeply will leave. You will experience sadness and fear. You will ask yourself: What could I have done to keep them? What can I do to keep those that are still here? 
You will come up with many ideas. And in my experience, all of them will be good ideas, but none will hit the mark. Why? Because there is no one solution. Each star performer is experiencing a different thing.
So, what to do? Ask. 
I ask this question of all my star performers (meaning everyone in my organization, because if they're not a star performer, I help them find a great role elsewhere):
How are you feeling about your work life, 1-5 (with 3 being ""meeting expectation"")?
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
I then see if I can make these conditions occur. 80% of the value is in me asking the question and listening to the answer so that my star performer feels heard. 20% of the value is creating the requested condition so that my star performer feels cared for.
I then go further and ask: 
How do you feel about your life overall, 1-5?
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
I ask this because dissatisfaction at home leads to dissatisfaction at work. If I can help my star performer create more peace at home, she/he will bring that peace/joy to work. 
This step has been game-changing for my team. We have been able to raise the productivity of some team members 10x by helping them sort out their personal life.
I then go further still and ask:
If you work remotely, how are you feeling about your Work From Home (WFH) setup, 1-5? 
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
How are we performing as a company, 1-5?
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
What is it like to work with the rest of the team, 1-5?
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
And finally:
What is it like to work with me, 1-5?
If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5? 
If the answer is <3, what would make it a 3? 
Ask these five questions. Listen to the answers. Pick the category with the lowest rating.  Focus on that one for now.  See what actions your report and you can take.  Do them. Report back to each other on them.  See your star performers' feelings of joy and satisfaction rise!
I find that a good cadence for asking these same questions is monthly.  Its enough time for real change to occur.  I also find that I do not need to be the one to ask these questions.  I am able to pair my reports with each other, who can then support each other in asking these questions.  And they of course let me know whenever there is an issue or block that I am causing (or can help solve).  

While I talk about using this method for star performers, the reality is that all team members benefit from these questions. And if you're not interested in investing the time needed to ask these questions of some of your reports, the question I have for you is, ""Why are you still working with those people?""","To retain star performers, ask specific questions about their work life, overall life, WFH setup, company performance, team dynamics, and leadership."
Step by step guide to building high performing teams (by Sabrina Wang),https://mm-coaches.notion.site/Step-by-step-guide-to-building-high-performing-teams-a1d3c70c031144738943e043933d3267 ,"### What does a high performing team look like?

Before we talk about the how, let me share with you what I believe a high performing team looks like. Taking from my experience coaching Series A through D CEOs and execs, as well as my time managing a team of stellar [Mochary Method coaches](https://coach.mocharymethod.com/), I was able to synthesize these commonalities.

1. **They are aligned with and motivated by the [company vision and culture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6ks72TkBIlgPDh6_n-NBBE7e_7nQ2YZ6B4BF12IQEs/edit#)**
    
    High performers deeply resonate with the vision of the company. They are proactive in aligning their personal vision with the company vision to create win-win scenarios. 
    
    They embody similar values as the company culture. For example, many companies we coach (and our own) have a cultural norm of transparent and immediate feedback. The high performers in these environments truly believe feedback is a gift; they are active in giving and receiving.
    
2. **They execute quickly**
    
    They are comfortable navigating ambiguity. They feel secure to iterate, fail and learn rapidly. They take an idea and run towards completion with accountability.
    
3. **They leverage their [Zone of Genius](https://www.notion.so/Step-by-step-guide-to-building-high-performing-teams-a1d3c70c031144738943e043933d3267?pvs=21)**
    
    They have awareness around what their ZoG is and spend the majority of the time working in them. They also understand their weaknesses, and are proactive in [outsourcing, delegating or making it awesome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit).
    
4. **They bring solutions with an owner mindset**
    
    They think of problems with a framework akin to [Issue Proposed Solution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hn_E1UFYruM1sXATsSwIydIJ4EsxMvxlnyoypOVRb_M/edit#heading=h.6ww0l7nn95nc), where they present you with solutions to get feedback. They state their intention and explain why instead of asking for permission (see [Turn the Ship Around:  “I intend to …”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uf5W4C0KG6Ywgsnh0TFlNbZTGymdgeTODAkpBYfj6Bo/edit)).
    
5. **They lift each other up and strive for positive sum**
    
    High performers enjoy working with other high performers. They raise the bar constantly. They are eager to help their teammates and understand that we win together.
    
6. **They master the balance of asking for help and figuring it out**
    
    High performers don’t wait too long to ask for help. When they do, they clearly state their request and the work they’ve done already in tackling this problem.
    

If you resonate with the above, the following steps will make your high performing team a reality at your company.

### Step 1: Hire and Fire Well

In order to create high performing teams, you have to hire and fire well. We have a full process on [**Recruiting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw1bOV14woAMGV7x_RI_yjWSuUa1aDDfDgL2M8Vg7sA/edit#heading=h.f0urh1glpy37).** I will include some other battle-tested tools that help with the hiring process.

- **New hire and manager’s 30-60-90**
    
    A 30-60-90 is a desired outcomes plan written in [SMART format](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) when a new hire hits the 30-day, 60-day and 90-day mark.
    
    I encourage my clients to come up with a 30-60-90 for the new role *before* the recruiting process starts. This will help you envision success for the role, and therefore you can better communicate it with a candidate. In addition to that, a CEO can come up with her own 30-60-90 to think about how she can best ramp up for this role. This is what I call **a manager’s 30-60-90**. See below for an example:
    
    - If you’re hiring a CTO, and you would like her to revamp the hiring process for engineers by day 60, then you can ask yourself: What are the things I can do in my control from day 0 to 60 to set her up for success? The answer may be to identify key success criteria and get historic engineering close rate from HR by day 30.
    
    If you’re hiring executives, you may provide a rough draft of the new hire’s 30-60-90 during the hiring process and have a working session with late-stage candidates to finalize the plan. This is a great opportunity for you and the candidate to get a sense of working style, as well as see if you’re a great fit for each other.
    
    - **Screen for value-fit**
        
        The best way to screen for culture is through direct personal experience or referrals. 
        
        For direct personal experience, design a trial project or period with the new hire where you can observe them in action. To hire our current team of coaches, we invited dozens of stellar candidates to participate in a week-long coaching bootcamp after moving through an interview process. We got to see how they interacted with each other and us in real-time. We also got to see how they performed.
        
        As for referrals, here are some great questions to assess a candidate’s value:
        
        - What values do you think they embody at work?
        - How would you describe your relationship with them?
        - What has been consistent for them?
        
- **Anti-sell**
    
    Anti-sell is where you transparently share the uniqueness and the drawbacks of a role. You clearly state your values and filter out candidates quickly. It also creates trust and transparency with the candidate. Though anti-sell can be done at any point of the hiring process, I recommend that you do it early on to be sure you’re only moving on aligned candidates. 
    
    Anti-sell is effective when combined with selling the vision, company, leadership and the opportunity. The candidate should already be excited about the opportunity before you anti-sell.
    
    It’s a radical method. But if candidates get through the anti-sell and still decide to continue with this process, you have increased the probability of them becoming a high performing candidate who is aligned with company vision and culture.
    
    If you’d like to try anti-sell, here’re some real examples I’ve heard from CEOs:
    
    *This role pays 200K. Someone with your experience can easily go to a larger tech company and get paid more. You’ll never be able to make a high cash comp at our company. But we will give you the best coaching, development opportunities and exposure. What are your thoughts?*
    
    *Not everyone is used to my management style. I’m direct and have been called “aggressive”. If there’s a feedback, I’ll give it to you immediately and honestly. However, I fight like hell for my direct reports to get the opportunities of their dreams. I challenge them so they have years of growth in months. People who like my management style have stayed with me for years and decades through multiple companies. Are you into that?*
    
    If you observe hesitation from the candidate, it would be a great opportunity to get curious and see if there are things you’d like to share to assure them. If not, then it’s likely not a good fit. 
    
- **Fire well**
    
    According the Matt Mochary, the single most important thing to build a high performing teams is to fire well. This means that managers let go of every single not-good and good performers. Leaving ONLY high performers. This doesn’t get done enough. Even if it gets done at the CEO level, it is difficult to implement with other managers at the company. Here are the key components to firing well:
    
    - Create a [performance reviews system](https://www.notion.so/Performance-Reviews-37354f8a9b50460cb6cca55510945ef4?pvs=21) that leverages frequent absolute feedback.
    - Have a clear talent density policy. For example, if a new hire is underperforming in A-B weeks, they will be given extra coaching, training and written feedback to improve. If the new hire is still not improving in B-C weeks, they will be let go with the [Firing Well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit) approach.
    - Making firing well part of manager’s performance review. They are held accountable to give clear absolute feedback and run peer 360 feedback to identify not-good and good performers. They will report on firing decisions with those employees.

### Part 2: Create Trust

Trust is created with **clarity, care, transparenc,y and consistency.** Trust is the prerequisite to feedback. Feedback is the prerequisite to high performance.

So, how do we create trust? 

1. On day 1, achieve **clarity** with three components:
    - **Working agreements**
        - My colleague [Georgia Dienst](https://www.notion.so/Georgia-Dienst-7f46a6dec532402b965e236450f4038c?pvs=21) wrote about how to create [working agreements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDtI8qq7Cm8qNNMzjM9n_5FHGCTogiPwReJxbgUm1Qo/edit?usp=sharing). I recommend having all agreements written down in your 1-1 doc. These are my favorite questions to ask my direct reports:
            - What does it look like when you get triggered? What can the I do in these situations? I will then answer the questions myself and write down the answers.
            - How will we use our 1:1 time together?
    - **What excellence looks like**
        - Share with them a written documentation of what 5 out of 5 looks like at this role and give them time to ask questions.
        - A simple version of 5 out of 5 is inspired by [Absolute Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit)
            1. Your current rating for your job function, 1-5, is …
            - 4-5 is above expectation
            - 3 is at expectation, and you can outperform by following *next level* guidance.
            - 2 is below expectation, and you can quickly improve with *next level* guidance.
            - 1 is far below expectation. I am now putting you on a written 30-day Performance Improvement Plan.
            1. What you did that I liked is ...
            2. What you need to do to get to the next level is …
        - For a detailed breakdown of 5 out of 5, you can use the [Job Responsibility Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dMxcNgm3pQe_dR9_UjwucbxtSG1k7Wj8RFdQag5FQ-U/edit) by my colleague [Faith Meyer](https://www.notion.so/Faith-Meyer-7be84956b4de4ee2b7c30f441db90dc3?pvs=21).
    - **Reiteration of 30-60-90**
        - Go through 30-60-90 plan for the new hire again to answer questions
2. Show your **care** by actively listening and remembering what is important to their professional and personal life.
    - To scale this, you can assign a DRI to track a **[personal info sheet](https://www.notion.so/26259e44275a4ea38adabd30abc2ce3c?pvs=21)** for all incoming new hires
    - Run [Magic Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kFZcqm3zaS5uY4QmG307BViQyoSbDDS1U04NpYhmes/edit) with your direct reports monthly
    - Ask for your direct report’s **5-year professional dream**. Document it in your 1:1 doc and discuss progress against it at least every quarter
3. Practice **transparency** by giving clear, unbiased and challenging absolute feedback monthly at the very least.
    - You can refer to my [Performance Review](https://www.notion.so/Performance-Reviews-37354f8a9b50460cb6cca55510945ef4?pvs=21) write-up to learn how to create a system of direct feedback.
4. Last but not least, lead with clarity, care and transparency **consistently**. Identify the tools that make the biggest impact to your people, then assign an internal DRI to create reminders and repetitions of these tools.

I know two types of CEOs. One type will read the above and think “Wow, that’s way too much work.” The other type will be excited by the opportunity to deepen trust with their team. 

For the first type, know that you can delegate some of these responsibilities to a COO, CoS, or VP of HR. Someone at the organization who is an excellent manager and loves doing this work. I would highly suggest **not** to outsource giving direct feedback and remembering personal info of your direct reports. 

For the second type, have fun! 

### Part 3: Ongoing Development

Onboarding typically ends at 90 days, but high performers crave ongoing challenge and development. I will include a list of tools that are most popular with Mochary Method CEOs and the internal team:

- **Clear alignment**
    - Frequently share the Mission, Vision and Values for the company. This is the CEO’s primary responsibility, but each exec team lead function will also circulate a more detailed version of MVV that applies to their teams.
- **Training and Teaching**
    - [Onboarding a new hire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwrvtGTdhCbxparQ3a4y7Z5RidSHXzsZORoGTubcY3U/edit) talks about shadowing, reverse-shadowing and feedback. This doesn’t have to be limited to the initial period. Whenever someone’s AOR or interest changes, they can continue to shadow and reverse-shadow.
    - As your company grows, the CEO will be challenged to think about how to teach on a higher scale. A popular tip is to record Looms and assign a DRI to organize and publish them. One of my clients records dozens of Looms at a time talking about the culture, management style and values and schedules them to be sent out in Slack.
- **Accountability and verification**
    - Assign a DRI at the company (I’ve seen CEO, COO, CoS, or Biz Ops do this) to keep track of team goals and their actions on a monthly to quarterly basis. Ask the team leads why they didn’t hit their goals and what they intend to do about it.
    - Assign a DRI (can be the same or different DRI as above) to verify that all managers including C-suite are giving frequent absolute feedback. One Mochary Method CEO personally goes into their feedback management system and spot checks the absolute feedback herself for accountability.
- **Coach and challenge**
    - The simplest and highest ROI coaching tool in the Mochary Method curriculum is the [Issue / Proposed Solution template (1-1)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hn_E1UFYruM1sXATsSwIydIJ4EsxMvxlnyoypOVRb_M/edit#heading=h.6ww0l7nn95nc).
    - Think about your direct report’s 5-year dream and find overlap with the company’s best interest. How can you challenge them to push them outside of their comfort zone?

### Summary

Here’s how you can create a high performing leadership team:

1. Hire and fire well. Ruthlessly screen for culture fit. Prepare in advance what success looks like to you and the new hire. Let go of employees who are not high-performers.
2. Create trust with clarity, care, transparency and, consistency.
3. High performers will need ongoing development. If new hires don’t meet the bar, have clear talent density requirements to let under-performers go gracefully.

It takes a lot to hire, motivate and train high performers. But it will be one of the most worthwhile investments you can make.","High performing teams align with vision, execute swiftly, leverage strengths, bring solutions, support each other, ask for help, hire and fire well, and create trust for ongoing development."
Teaching / Training (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGF4V0xFWjESabSZElwF3YienjtiLZtp81YTHe-zMpM/edit ,"Teaching / Training (1 min)
To perform a job well, a person needs to have: 
the skills to do so
the organization to follow through
the behaviors that match the company's values
You can teach all of these. 
Therefore, failure to perform is most often a failure of training or hiring.
The best way that I know of to teach (or train) is:
You watch me perform the role several times. You document the process that you see me going through.  Feel free to ask questions. Once I think that you understand what I am doing …


I watch you perform the role. I will give you regular feedback. Once I see that you are performing the role well …


You train your backup to do it. This training is what actually solidifies the learning for you, as it forces you to understand what you are doing to explain it to another.
If you are training a manager or new hire, this looks like:
You watch me run all of the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.
You write down my process for running the 1-1s and team meetings.
I watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks and give you feedback.
You invite your #2 to watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.
You watch your #2 run the 1-1s and team meeting for 2-4 weeks.

Technology-Enabled Service Provider (TESP) (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ug15Yz6p8LpgI6J3pYsza8PYtiBHwQzYKQ4WjeEYsnI/edit ,"Technology-Enabled Service Provider (TESP) (2 min)

Video of Matt explaining this write-up: 3 min
A technology-enabled service provider provides an offline service (shipping, insurance, legal advice, real estate brokerage) but is made more effective and efficient through technology. 
In the world of software, where no humans are needed each time a customer uses the product, gross margins are usually over 90%. So investors don't have to worry about the distinction between revenue and gross profit. They are nearly the same. Product Market Fit is then determined by how many customers are willing to pay for the product. Many see $1mm of revenue (for custom code) as a good proxy.
However, in a technology-enabled service provider (TESP), humans are definitely involved each time a customer uses the service. Gross margins are never as high as 90%. And sometimes, they are negative. Investors have been using the $1mm revenue mark as proof of PMF. But that metric is not relevant in a TESP. I can easily garner $1mm of revenue for legal services if I provide $2mm worth of a lawyer's time. And this is what many TESPs have been doing. Rather than building a profitable business, they have focused on what they need to do to raise each further financing round. The answer, until now, has been … growth and custom code.
The further problem is that as each of these TESPs grows, it becomes harder to change the core workflow to make it profitable. All they are doing is building a company that loses more and more money.
Luckily, there is an answer: Stop growing!
Instead, take the users that you currently have (you don't need many) and value-engineer your process over and over again until you have created as much variable margin as possible. Only then is it time to scale. 
Because PMF in a TESP is not $1mm of revenue, instead, it is >50% variable margin.
The process to get to >50% variable margin should be:
Make the process as efficient as possible using only off-the-shelf technology, then …
When the process is not changing anymore, write custom code to add the final bits of functionality that the 3rd-party tools cannot.
To do this, you will have to:
Find a funding partner who agrees with the perspective above
Raise a lot of money, and then pivot away from growth to efficiency (I don't recommend this, as it is duplicitous)
Not raise any outside capital
I strongly suggest that you consider the third option.
I have gotten good pushback on this write-up. It goes like this:
""It's important to demonstrate the ability to create attractive unit economics, but there is a legitimate strategy of foregoing high variable margin for high growth, i.e., pricing low to gain market share and dominate the market, and only then raise prices and pull in huge profits. This is Amazon, Uber, DoorDash. When lots of capital is available, this is usually a good strategy.""
I agree. The key is first proving that there is attractive unit economics before choosing to forego them. You'd hate to become a $1b revenue company only to find out that you actually can't create positive margin.  ","A Technology-Enabled Service Provider (TESP) combines offline services with technology for efficiency. Profitability relies on >50% variable margin, not just revenue."

The Course
This is a course in inner peace. The intention of the course is to be the most effective, efficient way for you to experience inner peace. Specifically, the aim is to use the fewest, simplest words to guide you to experience inner peace. I promise that, if you are open and do the practices outlined, you will experience inner peace upon completion of the course.

Subject v Object

One of the more useful distinctions in language is the distinction between subject and object. The boy has a ball. The boy is the subject and the ball is the object. In this example, it is clear that the boy is not the ball. The subject is not the object. Similarly, you have thoughts, feelings, and sensations. You are the subject. Thoughts, feelings and sensations are the objects. You are not the thoughts, feelings, or sensations. You have a body. You are not your body. You have an image of who you are. You are not the image.

Past and Future

All thoughts are about the past, the future or abstract concepts. You cannot experience reality directly through thoughts. Reality only occurs now. What, then, experiences reality directly now? You do. You are that which experiences reality directly in the now moment.

All events are neutral

All events are neutral. All circumstances are neutral. It is only your thoughts about the events and circumstances that are positive or negative. When you think that an event or circumstance is negative, you resist it and suffer. When you think that an event or circumstance is positive, you may attach to it and suffer when it goes away. This includes money, health, relationships, death and dying.

Direct experience is peaceful

When you experience reality directly without judgment, you experience peace. Think about the peace you experience when looking at a beautiful sunset. It’s not the sunset that causes you to experience peace. It’s that, for this one moment, you let go of wishing anything was different. You create peace by letting go of wishing anything is different than it is, now.

Misidentification

Suffering is a byproduct of mis-identification. When you think you are your thoughts, feelings and sensations, you label the thoughts, feelings and sensations as positive and negative. The focus of your life becomes experiencing the thoughts, feelings and sensations that you label as positive, and experiencing only the circumstances and events that you perceive as leading to those thoughts, feelings and sensations. You think you need to control events and circumstances, including events and circumstances that are outside of your control, to be ok.

When you think you are the image and narrative you have in your mind about who you are (37-year old female, went to this school, work at this job, have this many kids), the focus of your life becomes improving the image and narrative (money, status, success, fitness, attractiveness, etc). You think you need to control your image to be ok.

When you think you are your body, the focus of your life becomes keeping the body healthy and alive. You think you need to control what happens to your body to be ok.

Who are you?

If you are not your thoughts, feelings, sensations and you are not the image or narrative about who you are and you are not your body… then who (or what) are you? You are the one noticing the thoughts, feelings and sensations. You are the one noticing the image and narrative you’ve made up about yourself. You are the one noticing your body grow and change throughout your life. You are that which experiences reality directly. You are the one reading these words right now. The same one that feels like it’s been “in there” since you were little. The part of you that hasn’t and doesn’t change.

The nature of being

The nature of who you are is peaceful. Like the fragrance of a flower, peace is inherent to being who you are. It does not need to be obtained or achieved. It’s what’s left when you strip away identifying with all that’s not you.

Love and Fear

Love is that which embraces and allows everything. Love is unconditional by its nature. There is no such thing as conditional love; that’s not Love. When you experience reality directly now with no judgment, resistance or attachment, you experience Love. When you love another person, you experience that person directly with no judgement, resistance or attachment. To love is to experience directly with no judgment, resistance or attachment.

Love is a choice. You can choose to experience an event, circumstance or person directly without judgment, resistance or attachment. When you love, you experience peace. To experience inner peace simply requires the choice to love everyone and everything, now. So… what gets in the way?

Fear. When you choose not to love someone or something, it must be because you are scared. Why else would you choose to disturb your own peace? Why would you choose not to love someone or something? You are scared to choose to love that person, event or circumstance. It may help to recall a time you were scared of something happening only to find that the experience once it actually happened wasn’t as you anticipated. And notice how many of the future circumstances you feared never actually came to be?!?

Could you love losing money? Could you love having red wine spilled on your white couch? Could you love having your heart broken? Could you love being sad or angry? Could you love cancer? Could you love seeing your loved one die? Could you love your own experience of sickness, dying and death?

Instinctually, most people answer no. But why not? At some level, you can recognize that these are just experiences one can have, like any other. We think that these experiences cause us suffering, so we fear them. We attempt to resist them to avoid suffering. But actually, it’s the resistance itself that causes the suffering!!! Remember, all events and circumstances are neutral.

So… if you choose to love everyone and everything, now (and now and now), you will never suffer. You literally have nothing to fear except fear itself. Fear and resistance cause all suffering. Choosing to love eliminates the need for fear and resistance.

“The opposite of Love is Fear, but what is all encompassing can have no opposite.”

Letting Go

Again, to love is to experience directly with no judgment, resistance or attachment. This creates inner peace. The most effective way to create inner peace is to release all judgments, resistance and attachment. To release judgments, resistance and attachment, you must be aware of what you’re judging, resisting and attached to.

What’s unlovable?

To identify what you’re still judging and resisting, simply ask yourself: who or what have I not yet been willing to love? Choose to love those people, events and circumstances. Then ask: what parts of myself have I not yet been willing to love? Choose to love those parts of yourself.

What are you unwilling to let go of?

To identify what you’re still attached to, simply ask yourself: what am I unwilling to let go of?

A loved one? A spouse? A child? Meditate on their dying or leaving you. Truly imagine it, feel your feelings all the way through until you come to the realization that you would be ok without them. It likely is not your preference (and gratefully likely won’t occur for a long time if ever in your lifetime), and it’s critical to let go of your attachment to these people. You don’t need them to be ok. You may experience profound gratitude for them being in your life right now.

Money? Give away at least 10% of your net worth. And commit to give away 10% of your income and/or appreciation every year for the rest of your life. Notice if you feel fear or resistance to doing this. If so, you are attached to money and will suffer for it. Let go and be free. In this sense, money can’t buy happiness but giving away money can.

Health? Your body will decay and die. You may get sick or injured. Face it head on. Imagine yourself getting sick and dying. Death makes life sacred. Sickness makes health sacred. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do what you can to take care of your body and physical health, but attachment to your body remaining healthy will ultimately cause suffering.

Life? You will die. Everyone dies. Let go and experience peace.

To be sane in an insane world is insane

Most people experience stress, anxiety and suffering most of their lives punctuated by moments of peace. It is exceptional to experience inner peace. It is the explicit aim of this Course to reverse this phenomenon of the human experience. Clearly, the way most people are going about life is not working. If you knew it was possible to experience inner peace instead, wouldn’t you make different choices? And invite the people in your life to do the same? Now you do.

Inner peace

Most people’s experience with this journey feels like two steps forward and one step back (or sometimes even one step forward and two steps back). Keep going. Anytime (every time!) your peace is disturbed, you have chosen not to love something about yourself or your life. Identify what it is, release your judgment, resistance or attachment and return to peace. You can choose to love everyone and everything, now (and now and now). Will you?","Course teaches inner peace through distinctions like subject vs. object, past vs. future, and love vs. fear. Choose love for peace."
The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins) (By Celine Teoh),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_mOOt5qPPX5LrKCPmYz1S7KSMo-BGwRdHRISTDgFCk/edit?usp=sharing ,"The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins)
By Celine Teoh, Unicorn CEO Coach
Ever noticed how rare it is to hear “No” in your daily discussions? If you’re at the helm of a startup, that’s not just rare; it’s a red flag.
The Echo Chamber Issue
As a CEO, you’re often surrounded by agreement. This sounds great, but it’s a bubble. It’s like living in a false paradise where everything seems to be going smoothly, but beneath the surface, there are issues no one’s talking about. You’ve probably been blindsided by a project going south or an initiative flopping. And when you ask, “Why didn’t anyone tell me?”, you’re met with, “We saw it coming, but…”. This is the echo chamber in action. Speaking up, especially to challenge authority, isn’t always seen as safe.
Introducing the ‘Challenger’
What’s the fix? To start with: have a ‘Challenger’ in your team. This isn’t your typical naysayer. The Challenger’s role is crucial: they’re there to critically assess and voice concerns, to be the one who isn’t afraid to say “This might not work because…”. It’s about having that vital, often missing perspective.
Implementing the Challenger Role
The Challenger job is a tricky one. If someone gets locked into the role (“Oh, Kris is always the negative nay-sayer”), it does them no good because they lose credibility - everyone assumes they’re just saying no to say no. The solution here is to keep this role dynamic: rotate it among your team members. Today it’s Kris’s turn to be the skeptic, tomorrow it’s Lexie’s. This prevents anyone from being pigeonholed as the ‘negative one’ and keeps the feedback fresh and unbiased. Also, when junior team members take on this role, and their input is valued, it sets a powerful example – it says, “We’re all ears, no matter your position.”. Some tips:
Set Clear Expectations: Begin by clearly defining the Challenger role. Explain its purpose is to foster diverse viewpoints and robust discussion, not to oppose for the sake of opposition.
Regular Rotation: Implement a scheduled rotation for the Challenger role. This could be on a meeting-by-meeting basis or for a set period, like a week, to ensure everyone gets a turn.
Structured Feedback: During discussions, allocate specific times for the Challenger to present their viewpoints. This structured approach ensures the role is respected and integrated into the meeting flow.
Feedback Mechanism: After the Challenger speaks, encourage open discussion. This can be structured as a roundtable where each team member responds to the points raised, fostering a culture of open dialogue.
Support and Training: Provide support and training for team members taking on the Challenger role. This could include workshops on constructive criticism, conflict resolution, and effective communication.
Embed Challenging in Team Routine
Another approach is to weave this critical role into your team’s routine. After reaching a preliminary agreement, pause. Ask everyone to take five minutes to jot down potential issues or roadblocks privately, then go around the room and share. This way, you’re not singling anyone out – it’s just how you do things. By making the challenger role a structural one, everyone gets a moment to reflect and express concerns without personal risk. Tips:
Start with Why: At the beginning of each meeting, remind your team of the importance of critical thinking and diverse perspectives in driving innovation and avoiding blind spots.
Dedicated Critical Thinking Time: After initial agreement seems to be reached on an idea, pause and dedicate 5 minutes for solo critical thinking. Go around the room and share, or
Anonymous Feedback Option: Offer an anonymous feedback mechanism for team members who might feel hesitant to voice dissent openly. This could be a digital tool like Mentimeter.
Regular 'Devil’s Advocate' Sessions: Schedule regular sessions where the sole purpose is to challenge the status quo. These can be short, focused meetings where one or more team members are tasked with presenting counter arguments to current strategies or proposals.
Celebrate Diverse Viewpoints: Publicly acknowledge and celebrate when critical feedback leads to better decision-making or the avoidance of potential problems. This reinforces the value of the Challenger role and critical thinking in your team's culture.
Action Steps:
Start rotating a Challenger role in your team meetings.
Make it a part of your meeting process to collectively identify potential challenges to ideas.
Try these steps in your next meeting. They’re simple, yet they can profoundly shift how your team operates, ensuring that you’re not just hearing what you want to hear, but what you need to hear.

What other ways have you incorporated a challenger role into your teams?

The Great Reshuffle (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn1CRHz7vN_hx-Ndp50iuDgo4K_THe8cb2yOePZk0Hk/edit ,"The Great Reshuffle (2 min) 
Vaccines are rolling out. And CEOs are declaring their offices to be open. But not everyone is coming back. Many people are very happy working remotely in Nashville, TN or Boise, ID. They have no interest in going back to the office in San Francisco or New York. So what will happen? Will CEOs allow workers to stay remote if they want? Some yes, many no.
The world is about to split. The majority of CEOs will not have the conviction to declare a pure culture. Most will allow department heads or individuals to decide whether they want to be in-person or remote. 
But some CEOs will have the conviction to declare a unified culture. Some already have. Coinbase and Brex have declared themselves to be Remote First forever. Others are about to declare themselves In-Person First. And when that happens, the Great Reshuffle will begin.
Those workers who crave an in-person experience (and many do) will leave their Remote First company to join one that is now in-person. Those workers who want to stay remote (and many do) will leave their newly In-Person company for Remote First. 
Who exactly will leave first? Those with the most confidence that they can easily find another role with a great company. And who are those? People with confidence don't map 100% to those that are good. But there is a high correlation. So, those who leave early will be those who are generally very good. 
There will be a lot of short-term pain while this transition occurs. A lot of institutional knowledge will walk out the door. A lot of time-consuming recruiting and onboarding will have to happen. But there will be a silver lining. In-Person companies will recruit as many great people as they lose. Remote First companies will as well. 
And the Hybrid companies will sit on the sideline, breathing a sigh of relief that they aren't experiencing this pain. Until ….
Over the coming years, the stories will come back. People will talk. Those at In-Person companies will enjoy communing with all of their co-workers. Those at Remote First will enjoy being first-class citizens in a unified culture. 
Remote workers at Hybrid companies will not. They will feel like second-class citizens as information-sharing and relationship-building will more easily occur between those in the office. The exemplary remote workers will start to leave. And the Hybrid companies will not have gotten the benefit of hiring the best talent during the Great Reshuffle. Hybrid companies will therefore suffer. And eventually, those who are in person at those Hybrid companies will also start to leave. Why? Because their company will not be performing, and their equity value will not be what they want it to be.
The Great Reshuffle is coming. If you are the CEO and plan to go back to the office full-time or stay remote full-time, get ready for both the pain and the pleasure. Once the year ends, you will emerge much stronger.
If you plan on straddling the fence, enjoy the next few years … while they last.","As vaccines roll out, CEOs decide office policies. Employees may shift to remote or in-person work, causing a Great Reshuffle."
The Work (Byron Katie),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFsngmRUBn8pNSprDq_h_9baq-t0IiPPhWaPBrFUA7A/edit# ,"The Work (Byron Katie)

(This section was lifted straight from Clearbit’s Manager’s Handbook.)
In 1986, Byron Katie was coming out of the depths of a debilitating ten-year-long depression with a life-changing realization:
""I discovered that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn’t believe them, I didn’t suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that. I found that suffering is optional. I found a joy within me that has never disappeared, not for a single moment. That joy is in everyone, always.""
- Byron Katie
In other words, what was causing her depression was not the world around her, but what she believed about the world around her. Katie went on to create The Work, a simple framework for turning around beliefs in order to alleviate suffering.
Instead of hopelessly trying to change the world to match our thoughts about how it “should” be, we can question these thoughts and, by meeting reality as it is, experience unimaginable freedom and joy.
The four questions
There are four questions you can ask yourself to help turn thoughts around:
Is it true? (Yes or no. If no, move to question 3.)
Can you absolutely know that it’s true? (Yes or no.)
How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?
Who would you be without the thought?
The four questions in practice
For example, let's take the belief that ""John doesn't appreciate my input"" and go through the four questions.
Is it true?

 ""Sure, I remember he interrupted me mid-sentence last Tuesday.""


Can you absolutely know that it’s true?

 ""I guess there's no way for me to know his true feelings.""


How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?

 ""I feel angry. My chest tightens. It ruins any meeting that I'm in with John. I've been fuming about this all afternoon.""


Who would you be without the thought?

 ""My mood would be lifted. I'd be a lot happier. I'd be able to collaborate with John again and appreciate some of the qualities I love about him.""


So you see, instead of hopelessly trying to change the world to match our thoughts about how it “should be,” we can question these thoughts and, by meeting reality as it is, experience freedom and joy.
The turnaround
The next step is the turnaround. The idea here is to see that the opposite of your story is at least as true as, if not truer, than your original thought.
For example:
John doesn't appreciate my input.
Turn it around to the opposite: John appreciates my input.
Turn it around to the other person: I don't appreciate John's input.
Turn it around to yourself: I don't appreciate my own input.
Often we find that deep-seated anger with others is rooted in things we hate about ourselves; it's a projection. Regardless of the cause, these beliefs are causing us suffering. Realizing that you can turn that around will set you free and create lasting shifts in your thinking and your perception of yourself and the world around you.
But doesn't this lead to apathy?
Beliefs are very powerful, and negative ones can lead to a lot of suffering. By turning them around, you can alleviate your own suffering and then problem-solve from a place of playful curiosity.
Treat The Work as a meditation. It’s about awareness; it’s not about trying to change your mind. Would you rather be right or be free?
A full example of the practice
A great way of seeing the power in these simple questions is to take some real-world examples. Byron Katie has recorded a set of YouTube videos with her taking her guests through each question.
One such example is “my wife wastes her days.” A husband takes issue with the way his wife spends her time with the kids; he feels like he slaves away at work all day, and when he gets back home, he finds that his wife has wasted her day.
Byron: Is it true? Husband: Yes, from my perspective it is.
Byron: Can you absolutely know that it’s true? Husband: No.
Byron: How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought? Husband: I resent her. I feel like I'm working my tail off and I feel like she's a child; I'm picking up after her.
Byron: Who would you be without the thought? Husband: She's beautiful. I'm excited to see her. She's probably been doing cool, creative stuff with our boys. I'd be honoring all the things she does for our world during the day. She does things for us all day.
Byron: So with the thought, you're angry and resentful. Without the thought, you're connected, grateful, appreciative. So how does your wife's day have anything to do with your problem? What you're believing in the moment is the obstacle you're holding between you and your connection with your wife. Beliefs are very powerful. You think the thought, it keeps you blind to your love with her, your connection with her, and everything she does for your two children in your life.
Byron: So that thought, turn that around. Husband: She maximizes her days. I waste my day.
Byron: As far as I'm concerned, a day spent in resentment is a day wasted.
The purpose of The Work
The purpose of The Work is to become curious about all the possibilities of life. We find that this is done most effectively if you remain unattached to any outcome. This is not about valuing one thought above another, but it is about staying truly open to the exploration.",Byron Katie found joy by realizing thoughts cause suffering. The Work helps question beliefs to find freedom and joy.

It is critical to know how you are spending your time. 
Perceived Time
To do so, first write down how you think you do spend your time: 
what the activities are
what % of your time you spend on each. 
Here is an example:
Source new deals 20%
Support portfolio companies 30%
Internal firm meetings (with partners, staff, etc) 25%
Events and Conferences 10%
Board Meetings (for-profit) 10%
Board Meetings (not-for-profit) 5%
Target Time
Then write down how you would ideally like to spend your time. Be brutally honest. Here is an example:
Source new deals 80%
Support portfolio companies 10%
Internal firm meetings (with partners, staff, etc) 2%
Events and Conferences 4%
Board Meetings (for-profit) 2%
Board Meetings (not-for-profit) 0%
Actual Time
Then print out several weeks of your past calendar and add up how you spend your time hour-by-hour. You will likely be amazed at the difference between how you think you spend your time and how you actually spend your time. Be afraid of this perception gap.
Re-Allocate
For each activity that is over-allocated, start brainstorming ways to outsource or eliminate the activity. Use a thought partner. You are likely too close to these activities to see the actual possibilities for outsourcing or eliminating them.
Do not try to re-allocate by simply increasing the amount of time you spend on the most important activity. Time is finite, and you will end up killing yourself. Instead, focus on eliminating time spent on the less important things. You will then naturally fill the open space with the highest priority.","Assess how you spend time, compare to ideal, track actual time, and reallocate to focus on high-priority tasks."

Video of Matt talking about Top Goal (2 min)
In startups, fires never cease to burn. One of the most common complaints I hear from CEOs is that they seem to have infinite things to do on a day-to-day basis, yet weeks will go by, and they don't feel like they have accomplished anything. This dilemma results from getting bogged down with the small immediate things and losing track of the important long-term ones.
The Top Goal framework will help you fix this. Greg McKeown, who wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called Essentialism, boils this down to one key concept: Schedule two hours each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do this every single workday. Period.
The earlier in the day you schedule this Top Goal time, the better to avoid other issues (and people) from pressing for your attention. There is also strong, research-backed evidence to show that we have more decision and thought-processing energy early in the day when our brain is fresh and well-rested. Take advantage of this time when your brain performs at its best by doing the essential things first.
During this Top Goal time, do not respond to emails, texts, calls, and messages. Only work on your top priority during these two hours. If you follow this pattern each workday, you will achieve amazing things.
If you have never scheduled this kind of focused work time, starting with two hours a day will likely be too great of a leap. Instead, start by scheduling 30 minutes for tomorrow early in the day. If that goes well, then plan 30 minutes each weekday morning for a week. If that goes well, increase the daily scheduled time to one hour. Continue growing each week until you find the right balance, knowing that the recommended target is two hours.

Transition:  How to successfully transition a group to a new method (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlgcnKgY5AIl9IcWZJaywXHU6bg9Y8nOb-aqNNxbics/edit ,"Transition:  How to successfully transition a group to a new method (2 min)
The key to a successful transition is knowing that everyone wants to succeed and be seen as succeeding. Many people resist change because they feel fear that they will not know how to succeed using the new method, tool, technique, etc., or they feel fear around the time investment that it will take to learn to succeed.
The key is to alleviate this fear. And the easiest way to do so is to SHOW people how to succeed. 
I can verbally describe to someone how to take a jump shot, but there is no explanation good enough for someone actually to translate my words into an actual good-looking jump shot. However, if I simply take a jump shot in front of someone, they can easily see what they need to do, and they can copy it remarkably well. 
The same applies to all tasks.
Ideally, you show each person in a 1-1 setting so that they can practice without others seeing them until they feel that they are doing the new method correctly. Then you bring the group together and ask them to use the method as a group. This avoids the problem of someone feeling embarrassed that they haven't mastered the method while in the group setting.
But few of us have this amount of time to invest. An acceptable alternative is:
Meeting 1:
I show the whole group in real-time how to use the tool or follow the method. If anyone has questions, I answer them.
I ask everyone to now use the tool or follow the method while I watch. If anyone has questions, I answer them. If anyone gets stuck, I guide them to success.
Meeting 2:
I ask everyone to use the tool or the method on their own in advance of the meeting.
Meeting 3:
I ask those who like the tool or the method to show it to their team in the same manner. 
I have experimented many times with creating detailed instructions for people to prepare on their own for the first meeting to be more efficient. So far, it has never fully worked. Some followed the instructions but had questions and were frustrated that those questions weren't answered in real-time. Others didn't prepare and then felt embarrassed that they didn't.
When someone feels frustrated or embarrassed, they often want to end the thing causing them this negative feeling, i.e., they reject the new tool or method. 
Superhuman recognized this simple fact of human behavior and simply offered a human being to sit through each user's first use of the tool so that the user could feel successful on that very first use.
Please do the same for your team!","Successful transition involves showing, not just telling, how to use a new method to alleviate fear and ensure understanding."

Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)
Think about the people you like. Do you like people who talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
If you want to create a meaningful relationship with someone:
Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home.
Ask them lots of questions.
Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you.
When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. They will find it heartwarming to see someone who cares enough about the details of their life to remember them. 
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always enjoy that they took the time to meet.
Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""I would like to develop a real relationship with you."" That intent alone is heartwarming. And will make the person want to invest the time to create that relationship with you.
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the person is likely to say yes. If you have genuinely allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be extensive, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
If you aren't good at reading body language, wait. At some point, the person will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to work with you. Now tell me what your company does."" 
To summarize, the four keys are:
Ask them about their lives.
Prove that you heard them by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""
Let them know what you appreciate about them.
If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond, and you then have a willing partner (i.e., investor, customer, recruit) in whatever your endeavor is.
When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a substantial adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the technique, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective partners and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.
Strengthening the Relationship
Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This connection is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not every one of these rounds needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:
Matt,
Your old house, no??
Peter

I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him. 
Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me. 
Below is another example, a message of appreciation from Bill Trenchard of First Round Capital. 
Hey Matt,
Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!

Bill
I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:
At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as ""the handwritten note guy.""
So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. (Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his iconic blogpost, states that he does this every Friday for one hour. Andy Bromberg does it for a few minutes each day.) You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. 


Please know that the above techniques, and all of those I have written about in relationship-building below, are manipulative. You can use them for good (to create a connection with someone you will treat well) or for bad (to connect with someone you will not treat well). I hope that you will use them for good only.

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about building trust (5 min)
In a group ...
I coach many of the CEOs of the fastest-growing tech companies in the Bay Area. I host a monthly gathering of these CEOs, where they can share their challenges and get both tactical advice and emotional support. These CEOs have access to many other CEO groups because their investors are all in the top tier, and every top tier investor hosts such groups. But they tell me that they choose to attend my group over the others because my group is the one in which they trust the other participants most. Why?
In every group that I convene, each member must share something deeply shameful about themselves. When I first announce this, there is nervous silence. So, I go first. I share something quite horrific. And then I ask each person, ""Do you feel more or less connected to me? If so, why?"" Without exception, they all say ""More"" and then something like, ""Because I appreciate that you were willing to reveal yourself to me that way. What you did/thought/said is very human. I think in the same circumstances, I likely would have done the same thing.""
(Fear tells us never to reveal anything shameful. It tells us that if we do, people will be disgusted by us and never want to associate with us again. But my reveal proves otherwise.)
Then, I ask each person to share something equally painful. They do. But only because I have gone first and proved that revealing something truly vulnerable creates connection rather than destroying it. 
An example of something that I am ashamed of:
I preach that Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min), that you should never act in anger. And yet, I act in anger regularly. Several years ago, when I was coaching little league baseball, a parent was very competitive and wanted me to run many more practices. Still, he refused to participate (while nearly every other parent pitched in). After the season was over, he called me to tell me that I should never have volunteered to be a coach because if I hadn't, then his son would have landed on a team with a coach that was actually committed. Rather than listen and learn, I asked him, ""Where are you right now? I want to know so that I can tell you to your face what a f*(&ing asshole you are."" The only thing this accomplished was to create a rift in the town's society. From then on, people had to decide whether they would hang out with him or me. 
When listening to such a story, the key is to listen and appreciate only. The person revealing is not asking you to help them solve a problem. Instead, they are showing what they believe to be a character flaw. They want to know if you still accept them as they are. If you try to help them problem-solve, then you are saying, ""This character flaw is not acceptable. You must fix it for me to accept you."" If, on the other hand, you say ""Tell me more"" or ""Thank you for sharing that with me. I feel closer to you now."" then they will feel accepted as they are.
If you are willing to try this out, each member will likely feel deep trust toward all the others by the end of the first meeting. After that, sharing challenges from work and personal life is easy. 
1-1 …
The method works equally well 1-1. 
Peter Fenton is universally considered to be the best relationship-builder in the tech investing world. How does he do it?
One, he truly cares about people. But that isn't so unique. There are plenty of people who genuinely care, and they are great relationship-builders. 
So what makes Peter the best?
I posit that it is because he openly shares how flawed he is as a human being. When I first met Peter, within 5 minutes, he had told me things that felt like his deepest, darkest secrets. My instant thought was, ""I love this guy! He's not telling me how great he is. Instead, he's telling me how broken he is. He's so humble."" 
I then talked to other people that knew Peter, and each had had a similar experience when they met him. He shared his flaws with them…and they loved him for it!
Peter does not do this as a technique. He is very open about his flaws. And the world has rewarded him for it.

""Matt, I'm able to create trust and like with my reports (or partners) by following your methods, but how do I get my exec team members (or partners) to create trust and like amongst themselves?""
What worked for you will work for them. You just have to guide the exec team to it.
First, please read these docs on how to create trust and like with your reports/partners to make sure that you're following all of the steps:
Trust and Like (5 min)
Relationships: How to get good at them (2 min)
How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min)
Appreciation (1 min)
Praise (2 min)
Relationships - How to create a good one between a Manager and her Reports (3 min; 60 min for the links)
Next, help your partners or exec team walk through these same motions with each other. Here's how:
Create a sheet with Personal Info, Team - example (1 min). Put in your information. Then share it with your team and ask them to do the same.
Encourage your team members to ask each other about their personal lives using this info. This action allows everyone to get to know each other as humans and feel seen and cared for as a real person, rather than just a work contributor. You can model this in the first few minutes of each team meeting by: 
Asking one or two members about their personal life (yes, in front of everyone else … and rotating who you ask), or
Asking each person to spend 30 seconds verbally sharing a highlight from their personal life since the group met last. 
Once the team is doing the baby steps above and finding value, share with the team the readings above. Ask each team member to reach out to one another between meetings. You can even require it, as Gitlab does, through its Donuts tool: Remote: Gitlab's Guide to All-Remote (a while to read)
At an offsite, you can go deeper.  
Start with light Icebreakers
Then move to deeper exercises, like Trust, Deep (2 min). 
Please give this work a few hours. It will be scary. Hire someone to facilitate the process if you don't want to do it yourself. But get it done. Once you do, it will forever bond your team.
If you do hire a facilitator, they should be in person with you.  (I have experimented with facilitating a session where I was remote and the team was in person.  It did not work, because the team couldn’t sense the depth of my emotion when I shared my shameful thought.)
Keep the connection going by implementing a regular practice of peer feedback using this Feedback Form 1-1 (4 min). The cadence should be at least quarterly, hopefully monthly, and best bi-weekly (rotating the pairs which give each other feedback). 
If you follow all of these steps, it will deeply bond your team for the long term.

Turn the Ship Around:  “I intend to …” (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uf5W4C0KG6Ywgsnh0TFlNbZTGymdgeTODAkpBYfj6Bo/edit ,"Turn the Ship Around:  “I intend to …” (2 min)

Full video of Matt explaining how to turn the ship around (6 min)

In the book Turn the Ship Around, L. David Marquet recounts his assignment as commander of the worst-performing submarine in the US Navy’s fleet and his superior’s request that he “turn the ship around.”

The normal trajectory of a Navy sub commander’s career is to learn every job on a submarine (through rotations to each department) and then eventually become commander.  The commander then makes all decisions in the operations of the vessel.  The decisions are often sound, but they don’t come fast. 

Marquet was brought up on one class of submarine, and indeed knew all of the jobs on it. He was a very promising officer.  But then he wasn’t assigned to command that type of sub.  Instead, he was asked to turn around the Navy’s worst-performing sub.  It was a completely different class of sub than he had trained on, and he didn’t know how anything operated.  

Out of sheer necessity, he couldn’t make the decisions, but rather had to rely on his department heads to make the decisions.  Marquet simply asked the department heads to let him know what those decisions were before they performed the action, so that Marquet could ask questions or give feedback.

But to make it clear that the department heads should go ahead and act if Marquet weren’t available, he had them always say “I intend to ….”    That way, if Marquet wasn’t available to give feedback, the department would go ahead and act anyway.  And even if Marquet gave dissenting feedback, the department head was still encouraged to do what they thought best, simply knowing that they also owned the results.

Marquet prayed that nothing disastrous would happen. 

Instead, something miraculous happened.

First, department heads started coming to Marquet earlier and earlier with well thought out decisions.  The actions occurred whether or not Marquet was available for feedback, so overall operations sped up dramatically.  Whenever Marquet did have questions, they were often about how the decision would affect other departments.

Soon, department heads started presenting this information proactively for Marquat before he even asked.  Because of this, each department head started thinking like a commander (assessing how each decision would affect all the departments and not just their own).

This shift in mentality led to two amazing outcomes:

Not only did the sub turn around:  it became the best-performing sub in the fleet after several years.

Prior to Marquet taking over, the sub had the lowest % of promotions of any crew in the fleet.  After several years, it then had the highest % of promotions.  The department heads who were thinking like commanders every time they said, “I intend to …” were effectively training themselves for the commander job.  This was recognized, and they were promoted to commander more than any other sub’s crew.

I (Matt) have applied this same technique inside the Mochary Method’s small team.  The results have been remarkable.  I feel fully informed, but I am no longer the bottleneck.  And the quality of decisions, actions, and buy-in from the team has gone up dramatically.

This technique is now being used in many of the companies that I coach, and the CEOs all report positive results.","L. David Marquet transforms Navy's worst-performing sub by empowering department heads to make decisions with ""I intend to..."" phrase."

There are many ways to create your company values. 
A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you …."" This is appropriate when the company is small, and values are entirely aspirational.
Another version is to acknowledge the culture that you already have. To do this, each Leadership Team member should pick one person in the company who is NOT on the Leadership Team and exhibits a value that you wish would be a universal behavior. Name the person and the behavior. Then select 3-5 such examples. This method is best used when the company already has a sizeable team and existing culture. ","Create company values by completing a sentence or acknowledging existing behaviors, depending on company size and culture maturity."
What To Do When Feedback Isn’t Landing (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tsqGVufCXilMKmL6uaZLyvzirhj0Tmb_PfNc_OWWPb8/edit?usp=sharing ,"What to do when feedback isn’t landing due to Clarity and Capability (3 mins)
By Celine Teoh, unicorn CEO coach
You’ve read Feedback (15 min). You’ve tried implementing it. But you’ve now run into a common issue: unresponsive feedback recipients, aka feedback not landing. Here’s how it might show up in a coaching session: the CEO client says: ""My SVP isn't responding to feedback, despite several discussions. I'm starting to question whether their promotion was premature.""
When it comes to a lack of response to feedback, the answer might be contained in the Three C’s of Feedback Dynamics:
Clarity - Is your feedback request clear, behavioral and unambiguous?
Capability - Does the feedback recipient have the tools and skills required to act?
Caring - Do they have the motivation or drive to follow through?
In this article let’s deal with Clarity and Capability: situations where folks are willing but not able to incorporate feedback.

Clarity, or The Mind-Reader problem: 

Imagine telling your SVP, ""Increase visibility in the Sales CRM."" But what does ""visibility"" truly entail? You are asking them to read your mind. Instead, outline the specific actions you expect, such as, ""Update deal blockers daily in the CRM for our sales meetings, so I can help you unblock them."" 

How can you be truly specific in your feedback requests? 
A video camera should be able to capture the behavior you request
For example, a video camera could capture this request: “Please text me if you’re going to be more than a minute late to our meetings”
However, this request cannot be captured by a video camera: “Please be more punctual” 
Would you be satisfied if they exhibited the requested behavior?

Capability, or The ""Why Can't My Five-Year-Old Drive '' Problem:  
If you ask a five year old to drive, he can’t: he lacks the training, the hand-eye coordination, and he’s not tall enough to see over the wheel. Similarly, if you ask a fresh graduate to do the work of a seasoned VP, they can’t: they lack the required expertise. Ask yourself - or even better, ask them - how you might help them build the capability to do the job. 
Do they need training?
Can the task be broken into manageable steps?
Are additional resources - money, time, political capital - necessary?

To facilitate improvement, consider the ""I Intend To…"" Exercise: Ask the feedback recipient to send you an ""I intend to…"" statement before acting. This prompts them to identify the issue and outline their approach. As you review their intentions, you can offer guidance and adjustments, aiding their skill development.
David Marquet used this strategy to turn his nuclear submarine crew from “worst to first” in the Navy

TLDR: If your direct report is not responding to feedback and you suspect it’s because of capability (not willingness), make your feedback specific and behavioral, help them build the ability to do the work, and provide positive reinforcement. By doing this you can help your employee grow into their role through feedback.

When feedback isn’t landing due to Motivation (3 mins) 
By Celine Teoh, unicorn CEO coach
You're at the helm of a skyrocketing startup. You've given crystal-clear feedback to a pivotal team member and provided all the resources they might need — from time to finances. Yet, nothing changes. 
The answer might be in the Three Cs of Feedback Dynamics. 
Clarity - Is your feedback request clear, behavioral and unambiguous?
Capability - Does the feedback recipient have the tools and skills required to act?
Caring - Do they have the motivation or drive to follow through?
While we've previously delved into Clarity and Capability, today's spotlight is on the often overlooked but equally critical 'Caring', also known as motivation.
Here are some reasons why your team member might not be responding to feedback:
You’re not using the right Currency
People are driven by different motivators, both internal and external. A common error is assuming everyone is motivated by the same factors. However, while you might care deeply about efficiency, your feedback recipient might be more excited about opportunities to learn.
Allan Cohen and David Bradford in their book “Influence without Authority” call these different motivators “Currencies”. There are five buckets of Currencies:
Inspiration: Vision, Excellence, Moral/ethical correctness
Task: New resources, Challenge/learning, Assistance, Organizational support, Rapid response, Information
Position: Recognition, Visibility, Reputation, Insiderness/importance, Contacts
Relationship: Understanding, Acceptance/inclusion, Personal support
Personal: Gratitude, Ownership/involvement, Self-concept, Comfort
Some examples of how these currencies might show up:
A key employee might avoid working late hours because they need and value family connection time. (Currency: Relationship)
An emerging leader might not change strategies because they have a need to be seen as a leader who projects stability and decisiveness. (Currency: Self-concept)
The CEO might retain a close associate because she has a need to stay in her Zone of Genius, and the associate handles tasks the CEO finds draining. (Currency: Excellence)
Action Steps:
Engage in detective work to uncover currencies: Observe what your feedback recipient seems to care about. What do they say when they resist changing their behavior? What language do they use? Conversely, when have they gotten excited and motivated in the past?

Ask, listen and empathize: Engage your feedback recipient in a genuine conversation. Instead of seeing the lack of action as resistance, try to understand their underlying needs through gentle interviews. Ask open-ended questions like, ""Can you help me understand your reservations?"".

Brainstorm: Once you've uncovered their motivational currency, brainstorm together. What creative tactics can you come up with that serve their needs as well as the startup's objectives?

For Instance:
If their currency is gratitude, you might try writing them a heartfelt handwritten note, expressing your thanks in person, sending flowers, or acknowledging their contributions in public. 
Caution: The currency you use has to be authentic; an insincere thank you note might actually harm motivation!



The Feedback Feels Threatening
Let's face it, receiving criticism, even if it’s constructive, can feel like a punch to the gut. According to David Rock, humans instinctively respond defensively to perceived social threats that can be triggered by feedback. In his SCARF model, these threats can take the form of the following: 

Status: ""After this feedback, do my colleagues still respect me?""
Certainty: ""Does this mean I'm not suited for this startup anymore?""
Autonomy: ""They're trying to control how I work.""
Relatedness: ""I thought we were a team. Is that changing?""
Fairness: ""This criticism feels undeserved.""
Action Step:
Identify which aspect of the SCARF model your feedback might trigger - Ask the recipient what they are concerned about, then empathize and make them feel heard. If they are reluctant to share their concern, take a guess at what matters to them! 
Either way, address the perceived threat by stating your authentic positive intent. Once they feel less threatened and fearful, they'll be more receptive to your feedback.

For instance:
For threats to Autonomy you might say, ""I value your unique approach. My feedback isn’t to control but to discuss alternatives. How do you see yourself implementing these changes?""

For threats to Status, consider saying, ""Your role in our startup is pivotal. This feedback is to ensure we're maximizing our collective potential.""

If you can lean into your team member’s motivational currency and reduce social threat from SCARF factors, you might just find that they are more inclined to act on your feedback!



Finally, one exercise I’d recommend is The “Cheering for Learning to Walk” Exercise: Notice every small positive step your feedback receiver takes, and celebrate it. Do not give any constructive feedback for a few days. This breaks the habit of constantly focusing on the negative. 
When my daughter first learned to walk, I cooed and clapped every time she stood up or took a step. At no point did I chastise her for falling down. Apply the same principle to adults, including SVPs! Celebrate each step they take towards improvement, no matter how small, and you’d be surprised at how quickly behaviors shift. Yes, this means more frequently than at annual reviews. 
This is a surprisingly hard exercise. Most of us are hard-wired to give constructive feedback. Remind yourself that frequent positive reinforcement boosts morale and encourages change.


TLDR: In the fast-paced world of startups, effective feedback is critical. If your feedback isn’t landing, work through the three Cs - Clarity, Capability and Caring - to see what’s causing resistance.

"Writing vs Talking (and Video) (3 min to read, then 2 min video) Video",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUiRJKbZUmiFK2aWbYQtogxqrnygwFYwkLXwtnkyjFM/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Writing (and Video) vs Talking (3 min to read, then 2 min video)

Video from Matt about this write-up (2 min)

Individual
As your company scales, you will likely be delivering the same message to more and more people. Continuing to do so verbally will not scale. 
If you say something twice, write it down (in a Google Doc). From then on, when you want to convey that same message, share a link to the Doc. And then create a company Wiki, and post the link there. That scales.
Group
When people discuss an issue, efficiency is essential. When a team discusses an issue, each inefficient minute exponentially increases by the number of people in the discussion. 
If you want the most effective and efficient decision-making process, require that anyone who wants to discuss an issue write it up, along with the desired solution, ahead of time. This write-up aims to be thorough enough that there are few (or no) questions at the time of decision-meeting. You can achieve this in one of two ways:
1. The hard way: Write a comprehensive analysis from the get-go.
2. The easy way: Write a draft, circulate it to the meeting participants before the meeting, and invite comments and questions. Then write out responses to all of these comments and questions before the meeting.
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is famous for using this written method. He requires that anyone who wants to bring up an issue or proposal write up the item entirely before the decision meeting (with someone else writing up a counterproposal if necessary). Then spend the meeting reading the write-ups. Once the decision-making team has read them all, they will make a decision. If the team cannot reach a consensus, an appointed decision-maker makes the call. If there are still open questions, then the decision-maker assigns one or more people to research and, of course, write the needed follow-up. At the end of the next meeting, the participants will make the decision.
Though time-consuming for the sponsor, this method yields extraordinarily thoughtful decisions in a short amount of time. One person's extra effort and work will create net savings in time and energy across the whole group.

Imposing this process on a group is daunting. Here is a way to ease a group into it:
Meeting 1. Reserve the first 15 minutes of the meeting for all participants to write out their updates and issues. Then use another 10 minutes for all participants to read each other's updates and issues. Then discuss and decide. 
Use this method for 2-3 meetings, then...
Meeting 2. Require that all participants write their updates and issues before the meeting. Do not allow people to bring up an issue that they have not already written up. Use the first 10 minutes of the meeting for all participants to read each other's updates and issues. 
Use this method for 1-2 meetings, then…
Meeting 3. Require that all participants write their updates and issues by a specific time before the meeting (e.g., 9 pm the night before). Require that all participants read and comment on each other's updates and issues before the meeting. People prove that they have read the docs by having their comments in the docs themselves. Do not allow people to make comments in the meeting if they haven't already commented on the docs themselves. 
Note: It isn't easy to move from Meeting 2 to Meeting 3. It only works if everybody submits their written updates on time and reads each other’s in the narrow window between submission time and meeting start time. If even one person misses, they will be left out. You have a choice here; you can be militant and get to Meeting 3 or stay put at Meeting 2. Most companies (including Amazon) have decided that Meeting 2 is the right balance between functionality and enforceability.
Video
Talking certainly has its place. Writing is a faster download of fact-based information (content). But to understand the nuance (context, emotion), I need to hear it spoken. The ultimate communication, therefore, is both written and verbal. It starts with a written update/issue (to clarify thinking) and concludes with a short oral presentation (to share the nuance). 
To apply this, when reviewing a written issue in a meeting, ask all participants to read the issue and then have the proposer verbally present the issue before others write in their comments. 
To make this fully asynchronous, require that when someone writes up an issue or update, they record a short (<2 minute) video of themselves describing that same issue/update and send out this video along with the written one issue/update. That way, viewers can get the entire content and context asynchronously. Respondents can comment asynchronously. And decision-makers can then often make decisions asynchronously. (This has been magical for my coaching. I am now able to share meaningful advice/reactions before a meeting. Before the meeting, the coachee ingests that content, and the meeting itself becomes a 3x deeper dive than it was previously.)

The exception to asynchronous decisions is if the decision-maker has to clarify the proposer's or commentators' questions. This situation may require several minutes of interactive discussion, which the team can quickly do in the next team meeting. 
Another place where video is extremely useful is in recruiting, where you, the founder needs to sell the candidate on the company's vision. Why repeat that process over and over? Simply record yourself once, and share it with candidates in advance of meeting with them. Candidates will not only come to their first meeting with you more enthused about the company, but they will also feel more connected to you because they will feel that this is the ""second time"" they've met you.   

",Written communication scales better than verbal as companies grow. Jeff Bezos' method of written proposals leads to efficient decisions.
You Lost Your Job. Now What? (By Faith Meyer) (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yY-M3SB9cvB7tS3QVvCSJkQELgbvp0WNtj9OvKKv8Zg/edit?usp=sharing ,"You Lost Your Job. Now What? by Faith Meyer (2 min)

No matter how humanely or well it was handled, losing your job is one of the most traumatic events a person can go through next to losing a primary relationship or loved one. Here are three science-backed steps to take to find your way forward.

Process Your Emotions & Re-Regulate
Fear and anger give bad advice, and you likely are feeling a loss of control, some form of grief, scared, pissed off… most likely all of these all at once! 

Give yourself permission for the first few days to take no actions other than to handle yourself with care as you process what just happened. By giving yourself the space to process the emotions that come up around being fired or let go, you will recover faster than if you suppressed them. Why? 

When we avoid our emotions after something difficult happens, those emotions will tend to sneak their way into our metaphorical driver’s seat and unconsciously steer our decisions. We don’t want to make decisions about future employment with clouded judgment or out of desperation.

Also, remember that grieving a job loss is normal, and there is no “right way” to grieve. The most commonly accepted stages of grief are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. 


Look Back to Look Forward
Now that you’ve taken some time to process the emotional aftershocks, you’re likely in a more clear-headed space. 

If so, reflect on your experiences at the company and take an honest inventory of what went well (consider your zone(s) of genius) and where you see opportunities for yourself to improve going forward. What did you like about the company, culture and/or your role? 

It’s helpful to objectively reflect on where we could have done better so we can learn and improve going forward. However, it’s not constructive to tear yourself down, so watch out for negative thought spirals and be mindful of the stories you tell yourself in the absence of fact.

By learning from the past, and then orienting your mind to a positive that you want more of, you bring your conscious and subconscious online in a powerful way to start moving toward that outcome.


Create a Game Plan
This is a great time to reach out to your network for referrals, recommendations, guidance, support… you name it. In addition, here are some questions to consider as you create your plan of attack for the job search:


Where would you like to go? What would you like to do?
Do you need to update your resumé and/or LinkedIn?
Many people don’t take advantage of the Recommendations portion of their LinkedIn profiles, which is an excellent way for others to help highlight your key professional skills, experiences, attributes and/or successes.

What have other people done to successfully navigate the job search process? 
What job search sites or recruiters do you prefer?
Who do you know that might know of openings or who could make an introduction?
Be mindful of your emotional state. If depression develops or worsens, partner with a therapist to process the traumatic event(s) around losing your job and work on yourself so you’ll be ready to show up as your best self as opportunities arise.

Remember: Job searches are marathons, not sprints. This too shall pass. Practice patience and positive self talk. Pace yourself and create a structure for your days so you can maintain your wellbeing throughout this process. You can create a top goal for yourself to define and protect your time spent on the search and finding time for self care, restoration and creativity.

For many of us, losing our jobs is our worst nightmare. If that was true for you, remember this: You’ve made it through 100% of your worst days, and you’ll make it through this one too.

Zone of Genius (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UVWJox31Ani8Cq6Ymhm6DiVUiv5vPkOQd8ZdGpYmbs/edit# ,"Zone of Genius


Video of Naval Ravikant, co-founder of AngelList, explaining why you don't need to be CEO (22 min)

What is the Zone of Genius?  Well, there are four zones.


Zone of Incompetence.
Zone of Competence.
Zone of Excellence.
Zone of Genius.

Zone of Incompetence are the things that other people probably do better than you (ie- fix your car), and therefore you should outsource if they don’t give you joy.

Zone of Competence are the things that you do just fine, but others are as good as you (ie- clean your bathroom) and therefore you should outsource if they don’t give you joy.

Zone of Excellence are the things that you are excellent at (ie- better than others), but don’t love doing.  This is the danger zone.  Many people will want you to keep doing these things (as they gain significant value from you doing them, ie- key functions in your job), but this is the area that you should also look to move away from.  This is the hard one!

Zone of Genius are the things that you are uniquely good at in the world, and that you love to do (so much so that time and space likely disappear when you do them).  This is where you can add most value to the world and yourself.  This is where you should be driving toward spending most, if not all, of your time.

Some people worry that if each of us operates solely in our Zone of Genius that no one will be available to do the un-fun stuff.  This is a false fear.  There are many personality types.  For every activity that feels un-fun to you, there is someone out there who not only excels at it, but loves it. (Yes, even the “horrible” tasks, like firing people.)  The key in any organization is for people to be transparent about what their Zone of Genius is, and then map all activities to the right people (through an AORs list).

Now that you know what a Zone of Genius is, how do you identify yours?  Oddly, because time and space likely disappear when you are in your ZoG, you are probably not even aware of what you do that is uniquely amazing.  To discover it, you likely have to crowdsource other people’s experience of you.  Because others who interact with you can usually see it quite clearly.

To do this, identify a group of people who interact with you regularly.  Send them each a message:

“I am trying to understand the things that I am uniquely good at in the world.  It is difficult for me to see them myself.  But I am hoping that you can help me identify them.  Would you be willing to take 10 minutes to answer the following questions? If yes, thank you.  If not, no problem at all.  I understand that this is an imposition on my part.

In your interactions with me:
What do I do that you experience as “world-class”?  
What do I do where I appear to be experiencing fun, peace or joy (if different from above)?
What do I do that I am good at but that I don’t appear to enjoy?
What do I do that I am not better than others?
What do I do that I am actually worse than others?”","Naval Ravikant explains the Zone of Genius, where you excel and find joy. Identify it by crowdsourcing feedback on your strengths."
