Transition:  How to successfully transition a group to a new method (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlgcnKgY5AIl9IcWZJaywXHU6bg9Y8nOb-aqNNxbics/edit ,"Transition:  How to successfully transition a group to a new method (2 min)
The key to a successful transition is knowing that everyone wants to succeed and be seen as succeeding. Many people resist change because they feel fear that they will not know how to succeed using the new method, tool, technique, etc., or they feel fear around the time investment that it will take to learn to succeed.
The key is to alleviate this fear. And the easiest way to do so is to SHOW people how to succeed. 
I can verbally describe to someone how to take a jump shot, but there is no explanation good enough for someone actually to translate my words into an actual good-looking jump shot. However, if I simply take a jump shot in front of someone, they can easily see what they need to do, and they can copy it remarkably well. 
The same applies to all tasks.
Ideally, you show each person in a 1-1 setting so that they can practice without others seeing them until they feel that they are doing the new method correctly. Then you bring the group together and ask them to use the method as a group. This avoids the problem of someone feeling embarrassed that they haven't mastered the method while in the group setting.
But few of us have this amount of time to invest. An acceptable alternative is:
Meeting 1:
I show the whole group in real-time how to use the tool or follow the method. If anyone has questions, I answer them.
I ask everyone to now use the tool or follow the method while I watch. If anyone has questions, I answer them. If anyone gets stuck, I guide them to success.
Meeting 2:
I ask everyone to use the tool or the method on their own in advance of the meeting.
Meeting 3:
I ask those who like the tool or the method to show it to their team in the same manner. 
I have experimented many times with creating detailed instructions for people to prepare on their own for the first meeting to be more efficient. So far, it has never fully worked. Some followed the instructions but had questions and were frustrated that those questions weren't answered in real-time. Others didn't prepare and then felt embarrassed that they didn't.
When someone feels frustrated or embarrassed, they often want to end the thing causing them this negative feeling, i.e., they reject the new tool or method. 
Superhuman recognized this simple fact of human behavior and simply offered a human being to sit through each user's first use of the tool so that the user could feel successful on that very first use.
Please do the same for your team!"

Video from Matt about this write-up (2 min)

Individual
As your company scales, you will likely be delivering the same message to more and more people. Continuing to do so verbally will not scale. 
If you say something twice, write it down (in a Google Doc). From then on, when you want to convey that same message, share a link to the Doc. And then create a company Wiki, and post the link there. That scales.
Group
When people discuss an issue, efficiency is essential. When a team discusses an issue, each inefficient minute exponentially increases by the number of people in the discussion. 
If you want the most effective and efficient decision-making process, require that anyone who wants to discuss an issue write it up, along with the desired solution, ahead of time. This write-up aims to be thorough enough that there are few (or no) questions at the time of decision-meeting. You can achieve this in one of two ways:
1. The hard way: Write a comprehensive analysis from the get-go.
2. The easy way: Write a draft, circulate it to the meeting participants before the meeting, and invite comments and questions. Then write out responses to all of these comments and questions before the meeting.
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is famous for using this written method. He requires that anyone who wants to bring up an issue or proposal write up the item entirely before the decision meeting (with someone else writing up a counterproposal if necessary). Then spend the meeting reading the write-ups. Once the decision-making team has read them all, they will make a decision. If the team cannot reach a consensus, an appointed decision-maker makes the call. If there are still open questions, then the decision-maker assigns one or more people to research and, of course, write the needed follow-up. At the end of the next meeting, the participants will make the decision.
Though time-consuming for the sponsor, this method yields extraordinarily thoughtful decisions in a short amount of time. One person's extra effort and work will create net savings in time and energy across the whole group.

Imposing this process on a group is daunting. Here is a way to ease a group into it:
Meeting 1. Reserve the first 15 minutes of the meeting for all participants to write out their updates and issues. Then use another 10 minutes for all participants to read each other's updates and issues. Then discuss and decide. 
Use this method for 2-3 meetings, then...
Meeting 2. Require that all participants write their updates and issues before the meeting. Do not allow people to bring up an issue that they have not already written up. Use the first 10 minutes of the meeting for all participants to read each other's updates and issues. 
Use this method for 1-2 meetings, then…
Meeting 3. Require that all participants write their updates and issues by a specific time before the meeting (e.g., 9 pm the night before). Require that all participants read and comment on each other's updates and issues before the meeting. People prove that they have read the docs by having their comments in the docs themselves. Do not allow people to make comments in the meeting if they haven't already commented on the docs themselves. 
Note: It isn't easy to move from Meeting 2 to Meeting 3. It only works if everybody submits their written updates on time and reads each other’s in the narrow window between submission time and meeting start time. If even one person misses, they will be left out. You have a choice here; you can be militant and get to Meeting 3 or stay put at Meeting 2. Most companies (including Amazon) have decided that Meeting 2 is the right balance between functionality and enforceability.
Video
Talking certainly has its place. Writing is a faster download of fact-based information (content). But to understand the nuance (context, emotion), I need to hear it spoken. The ultimate communication, therefore, is both written and verbal. It starts with a written update/issue (to clarify thinking) and concludes with a short oral presentation (to share the nuance). 
To apply this, when reviewing a written issue in a meeting, ask all participants to read the issue and then have the proposer verbally present the issue before others write in their comments. 
To make this fully asynchronous, require that when someone writes up an issue or update, they record a short (<2 minute) video of themselves describing that same issue/update and send out this video along with the written one issue/update. That way, viewers can get the entire content and context asynchronously. Respondents can comment asynchronously. And decision-makers can then often make decisions asynchronously. (This has been magical for my coaching. I am now able to share meaningful advice/reactions before a meeting. Before the meeting, the coachee ingests that content, and the meeting itself becomes a 3x deeper dive than it was previously.)

The exception to asynchronous decisions is if the decision-maker has to clarify the proposer's or commentators' questions. This situation may require several minutes of interactive discussion, which the team can quickly do in the next team meeting. 
Another place where video is extremely useful is in recruiting, where you, the founder needs to sell the candidate on the company's vision. Why repeat that process over and over? Simply record yourself once, and share it with candidates in advance of meeting with them. Candidates will not only come to their first meeting with you more enthused about the company, but they will also feel more connected to you because they will feel that this is the ""second time"" they've met you.

7 minute video of Matt doing an Update with the current tools as of 7-29-23
For an organization to work well, three things must occur at every level of the organization.
Accountability 
Coaching
Transparency
(I use these particular words only because they form an easy-to-remember acronym: ACT)
Accountability is declaring:
A destination (Vision, OKRs, KPIs)
The action steps to get there (Actions)
Whether or not those actions steps were taken (and eventually the goal achieved).
Coaching is declaring:
The current health of the entity (company, department, team, individual). Both the Good and the Not Good.
With the Not Good, describe in detail the Issue and declare a Proposed Solution. (This is where reports can make requests for help from their manager or their peers.)
Transparency is declaring:
Feedback to people on how they can improve. This step should be to a person's: 
Manager
Peers
Reports 
(MM: need content)
Using ... 
This framework at first (relative feedback): 
Like. 
""These are the specific actions that I like that you are doing.""
Wish That. 
""These are the specific actions that I wish that you would do differently."" 
Then adding this framework (absolute feedback): 
Rating 0-10 in your role. 
8-10 is at or above expectation
6-7 is below expectation and requires improvement through following the Wish That feedback above.
0-5 is so far below expectation that you are now on a written Performance Improvement Plan.
To achieve a 10, you would … 


And then using this framework (Deep Feedback) every quarter.
This level of accountability, coaching, and transparency is best in both directions (from CEO to the company and the company to the CEO) at every level (company, department, team, and individual).
To achieve the best results, initiate a regular series of meetings:
One-on-One 
Team 
Company-wide (All Hands)
Office hours 
Quarterly planning
Each manager should plan to devote an entire day each week to internal meetings. The weekly team meeting will be the longest (up to three hours initially, until teams learn the habit of writing down all input before the meeting when it can get down to 30 minutes). The weekly one-on-one sessions and office hours will consume the remainder of the day. This timing determines how many team members a single manager can effectively oversee. If one of your managers can't fit all the necessary meetings into a single day, she has too many people reporting directly to her, and you need to re-organize, or she needs to run more efficient meetings. 
The overhead—twenty percent of the standard workweek—can feel tremendous to a startup CEO accustomed to the organic information flow of a small group working together in the same room. But without this one-day-per-week investment, a larger team will never fully know what to do, nor will the CEO get the needed feedback on her performance or the company's performance.
Calendar Cadence
Paul Graham of YCombinator, famously points out that makers (engineers) need long stretches of uninterrupted time to be productive, whereas managers are most effective when meeting. The compromise is to schedule days when no meetings are allowed. The schedule that works best for a five-day workweek is:
- 1 day of internal meetings
- 1 day of external meetings (i.e., interviewing candidates)
- 3 meeting-free days
It isn't critical when these days are, although it helps to space the two meeting days apart from each other.
The above schedule often comes under fire from recruiters, who worry that:
It won't be easy to conduct all onsite interviews on a single day.
Many qualified candidates won't be able to make it in on the appointed day.
First, your hire and close rate for candidates should be very high (approx. 75%)— otherwise, you are losing incredible amounts of time by doing all-day in-person interviews with many candidates you don't want to hire or don't want to work for you. Therefore, unless you are already hitting the 75% metric, you should start screening candidates more effectively (i.e., brutally) in your phone interviews and lower the number of in-person interviews.
Second, it is true that some candidates can only come on specific days or times. However, the benefits of having meetings on only one set day, as measured by the company's increased productivity, far outweigh the cost of losing out on a few candidates. Additionally, if the candidate cannot find the time to make it on a set day within two or three weeks, it is likely that they won't take the job anyway.
There are many other high-level candidates out there, and you can find another one. But there are only a finite number of productive work hours within the company. Once lost, there is no way to recapture them.
There are two exceptions to the advice above:
In the very early days of a company, when a department has just one person, the department lead can set a recruiting schedule that works for her as she builds her team. 
Departments that are entirely non-technical and don't require focused work time.
The guidelines above are for when a team is already in place, which requires uninterrupted days for its work. These steps are crucial for the Engineering team.
Meeting Order
When creating the schedule for the day of internal meetings, I recommend the following order:
1-on-1 meetings
Leadership Team Meeting
All Hands Meeting
CEO Open Office Hour
Company-wide social event
The 1-1 meetings are a time to ensure that each report is fully prepared for the team meeting. (As reports begin to prepare thoroughly for their 1-1 meeting in advance, their Accountability and Coaching can be pushed into the Team Meeting, allowing more time for Transparency during the 1-1).
At the Leadership Team meeting, all Issues are surfaced and either resolved or moved to a RAPID decision-making process. Then the Leadership Team can share all the decisions from the meeting at the All Hands meeting. The CEO Open Office Hour (which I highly recommend) can be scheduled anytime in the day. And finally, if you have a regular company social event (which I also recommend), the internal meeting day is a logical day to have it, as this is the day when most of your team will be in the office.
As the company grows, Department meetings (both 1-1s and Team) will likely have to happen on a different day. Just as the 1-1s are prep for the team meeting, the Department meetings are prep for the Leadership meetings. I, therefore, recommend scheduling Department meetings the day before the Leadership meetings.
Meeting Leads
It is essential that each meeting have a designated Meeting Lead, who is sometimes, but not necessarily, the group's manager. This person is responsible for making the meeting run well, which also means ensuring that all meeting participants submit their updates and issues in writing in advance and show up on time. The Meeting Lead must be ruthless about sticking to the timeline and, whenever something off-topic comes up, they should note it but schedule the discussion for another time. Finally, the lead must drive decisions and feedback to action items with DRIs and due dates and record these in the accountability system. 
Without an effective Meeting Lead, meetings quickly become inefficient, and people come to resent them.
One-On-One Meetings
To understand the basis for these meetings, I recommend that all team members read the same book to get on the same page about the purpose and structure of these meetings.
If you manage high-level managers, the best book is Andy Grove's High Output Management. 
If you manage individual contributors who are unlikely to read a long book like High Output Management, ask the team to read The One Minute Manager by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. It's a concise read (30 minutes), and it contains simple, practical advice. Assigning it uniformly to the team will ensure they have a common basis for proceeding.
The first One-On-One Meeting should occur soon after the onboarding process is complete. Have both the manager and the team member come to the meeting with written, measurable OKRs for the new team member. When the manager and team members reach a consensus on a set of OKRs (ideally three or fewer), merge these into one list.
Run subsequent meetings according to the following template. 
Team member:
Accountability (goals and actions): 
Last Week 
For each of your stated actions from last week, did you get them done? Yes/No? 
If No, what blocked you?
What habit can you adopt so that you don't encounter that obstacle again?
Next Week 
For each of your OKRs, what one action can you take to advance toward each of them?
Coaching (issues and solutions): 
Show your OKRs in traffic light fashion (green-yellow-red). 
Green= on-track. 
Yellow= slightly off-track. 
Red= far off-track.
Show your KPIs in a traffic light fashion.
Show any relevant pipelines (Recruiting, Sales, Customer Success, Engineering Roadmap, etc.)
If I were to dig into these updates, what would I discover in your department that is: 
Good
Not Good 
Please describe the Issue in detail, as well as your Proposed Solution. This Proposed Solution should include: 
What you can do to help solve the Issue.
What I (your manager) can do to help unblock you.
Please list any other Issues you see in the company, with peers, with the product, in your own life, etc. 
For each, please list your Proposed Solution. Even if you are unsure of the right course of action, take a stab at a definitive roadmap. It will help advance the conversation. 
Transparency (feedback): 
What did you like that I did as a manager?
What do you wish that I would do differently as a manager? 
Would you please think of the feedback you are afraid to give me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Would you please give me that feedback?
Manager:
Transparency: 
Get feedback from your report. 
Elicit negative feedback about your actions. Do this any way you can. Ask for it, appreciate it, and act on it. These actions are the key to making a team member feel heard and valued.
Once you have gotten critical feedback, either 
Accept 
If you accept, co-create a written action step that you can take to act on it. Put this action step on your group task manager so that your report can see that you actually do it.
Not Accept
In some rare cases, there will be feedback that you do not accept. That is okay, as long as you are clear about why you do not accept the request. 
Give feedback to your report. Declare: 
Since the previous meeting, what actions did your report do that you liked? Be specific.
What actions do you wish that your report would do differently? State these as specific future actions. Example: 
""I wish that you would ask for feedback from your direct reports in your 1-1s.""
Update the team member's goals: 
Ensure that the OKRs are still relevant.
Ensure that their declared actions for the upcoming week are the straightest line to achieving their OKRs.
Ensure that their Proposed Solutions are the straightest line to solving the Issue.
Ensure that they have copied and pasted all of their actions (from OKRs and Issues/Solutions) into the group task manager.
Schedule these meetings regularly, on a fixed day and time. The weekly schedule can be bi-weekly or even monthly once a team member develops expertise at her tasks and if her goals remain consistent over time. Another alternative is to set different paces for Accountability, Coaching, and Transparencies. I.e., Meet weekly for Coaching and Transparency, but do Accountability on a bi-weekly or monthly cadence.
On your day set aside for meetings, schedule One-On-One sessions before the team meeting. Schedule them back-to-back, and allot twenty-five to fifty minutes for each one. If there is a serious issue to discuss, such as profound job dissatisfaction, then use your Open Office Hour (see below) later that day to fully address the issue.
If a team is small enough, you can merge One-On-One and Team Meetings, but be cautious about giving negative feedback in a group setting. Shame is likely to arise unless your team has agreed to radical transparency and actively wants negative public feedback. Most companies, therefore, opt to provide negative feedback only during One-On-One meetings. 
That being said, I do recommend moving to a culture of radical transparency. Doing so will allow you to merge all One-On-One meetings into the Team meeting. This action can save you 4-6 hours on your day of internal meetings.
But radical transparency first requires explicit buy-in from every team member and training in how to do it effectively. Conscious Leadership Group runs excellent 1-day training in radical transparency. The investment of time may seem significant but usually pays for itself within a few weeks (i.e., saving a half-day per week).
Team Meeting
To support the company's quarterly goals, each team must meet weekly (or bi-weekly if the team is very smooth-running) to:
Hold each other accountable for the actions they need to perform
Surface and resolve any issues in the company
Give each other feedback
To ensure participants are prepared for the meeting, I recommend holding all 1-1s in the morning just before the team meeting. The 1-1s then serve as preparation for the team meeting.
During the team meeting, each attendee should:
Report whether they accomplished their declared Actions from the previous meeting. This response should be a simple YES or NO. If NO, they should also write WHY? they didn't do the action. And what HABIT can they adopt to make sure they never encounter that obstacle again? Here is an example: 
Get feedback from Joe. 
NO.
Why? I forgot about it and therefore didn't ask for feedback when I met with Joe.
Habit? Create an Agenda list. Look at this list each time I meet with someone.
Report their department updates 
Show 
Link to traffic-lighted KPIs
Link to traffic-lighted OKRs
The written update should be a deep dive into these metrics to share what has happened that is 
Good
Not Good. 
What exactly is the Issue.
What is your Proposed Solution for correcting the Issue?
Many people will say that they do not know what the solution is and want guidance. That is fine. But the discussion will be much more fruitful if they definitively declare what they THINK the solution is, even if they have very little confidence in their proposal.
Declare what actions they will do until the next meeting: 
Toward their OKRs
As part of Proposed Solutions
Provide feedback to the team leader and peers in the Like and Wish That format. 
Peer to Peer 
Each peer gives feedback to one other peer per meeting (on a rotating basis)
Reports to Manager 
If they did these in the 1-1, it is good to show them in the team meeting.
Manager to Reports 
Only if the company is practicing radical transparency, otherwise this remains in the 1-1
The agenda for the meeting then becomes:
Updates from each team member (1, 2, and 3 from above)
Discuss Issues and Proposed Solutions. 
Time-box each Issue. 
If the team agrees to a solution, turn it into Action Items with DRIs and Due Dates.
If the team does not agree to a Solution, turn the Issue into a RAPID.
Write and review Feedback to each other.
Team Meetings follow the same information flow as the 1-1s: Accountability, Coaching, and Transparency. In fact, as the team is effectively preparing in writing in advance for its meetings, the Accountability and Coaching portion of the 1-1s can be moved to the Team Meeting. This action is actually more effective and efficient, allowing more time during the 1-1s for Transparency.
It is essential to time-box all agenda items so that the meetings don't run on and all issues get addressed. You can complete this step by putting a number before each agenda item. You can indicate five minutes as [5]. At the end of the allotted time, move on. If there are still decisions to be made, create a RAPID. 
It is critical that everyone submit all of their updates, issues, and feedback in writing before the meeting, as discussed in Chapter 8 (""Writing vs. Talking""). This step allows others to read the submissions, make comments, and ask questions before the meeting. This action massively increases information flow and allows for consensus before the team meeting even begins. When done verbally, team meetings that take 3 hours can take 30 minutes (and be more effective) when done in writing.
Open Office Hour 
Each manager should set aside one hour each week for an open office hour, during which anyone can come to introduce an issue. This time ensures that all employees feel heard but limits the time required for the manager to a predictable level.
Company-Wide Meeting
On a cadence that varies between once a week and once a month, it is vital to have a Company-Wide Meeting where the results of the most recent leadership team meeting are shared. Follow the same format. Allow time, as always, for anyone to bring up their issues or provide feedback.
For another perspective, Peter Reinhardt of Segment.io shares: ""We use all hands for sharing across teams of what teams are accomplishing, working on, celebrating wins (reinforce our values), and recognition broadly... plus bringing in customers to talk. I find this much healthier than an obsession with whatever leadership team is talking about (although we do present the board deck + board topics once per quarter).""
Quarterly Offsites

Once a quarter, the leadership team (and eventually the entire company), which consists of all the department heads, should take a day or two to:
The Past. Do a retrospective on the prior quarter 
How did we do against our OKRs and KPIs?
How did we function as a team? (360 Feedback). 
The Future. Plan for the future quarter 
Refresh Vision and Values
Dig into Issues/Proposed Solutions 
Use the Emotions exercise shared in Issue Identification in Chapter 14.
Set the new company OKRs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals).
Refresh the company KPIs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals). 
Bond. Get to know and like each other as human beings. 
Structural activities 
If you really knew me ...
Peer Feedback 
Use the feedback exercise shared in Conflict Resolution in Chapter 14.
Unstructured activities 
Drinks at the bar
Sports, crafts, activities, etc.
Events where spouses are invited.
I recommend scheduling these offsites on a Thursday/Friday so that you can then offer an optional weekend unstructured event with spouses. Team members often would like to get to know each other, but they are waiting for you to organize the events that will allow them to do so.
Vision
To create the ten-year vision, imagine it is ten years from now. You are the dominant company in the industry. Ask yourself:
What industry do you dominate?
Who is your customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
What pain do they have that are you solving for them?
What is unique about the solution that causes the customer to choose you over the competition?
What asset (human or physical) do you control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy your solution? In other words, what is your moat?
Values
There are many ways to create your company values. A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you ….""
OKRs
For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3. Three Objectives with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs). 
The Objective answers the question: ""Where do we want to go?"". Key Results answer the question: ""How do we know that we're getting there?"" 
Here are examples:
Objective- Reach $500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
Key Results- 
Hire 10 additional SDRs.
Hire 5 additional Customer Success agents.
Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team.
Finally, use your Quarterly Goals Meeting to establish near-term actions. Ask yourself: 
""What actions can we take this week to stay on track for each quarterly OKR?"" 
Assign each Action to one person. At your next weekly meeting, the first thing you will do is ask everyone to declare if they completed their assigned Action.
Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Sheet. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an example.
For all OKRs that are far off-track, the DRI must create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.
Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting
As the company grows, each Team will become a large entity (i.e., Biz Ops, Design, Communications, Compliance, etc.). An individual product may grow large enough to warrant becoming a business unit with its own GM. Thus there will be many VP-level execs. You will want to keep them informed and empowered. There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not.
If someone needs to attend a meeting to be informed about what occurs or to have their voice fully represented, in that meeting, you have not yet created a transparent system. 
Each meeting should have clear notes of all updates and decisions made (other than those around compensation and individual performance improvement). The team should publish those notes to the company. So, everyone can know what happened in a meeting without actually attending. In addition, each employee should be encouraged, weekly, to write up any Issues they see in the company, their department, etc., and write up their Proposed Solution as well. Then the team member should elevate these written Issues/Proposed Solutions to the right decision-making meeting with the employee represented in her own written words.
The meeting then becomes a way of making good and fast decisions. 
Your Brain Trust should attend the Leadership Meeting. Who are the key minds that you need to hear from to make significant decisions? And which people run the central business units that you need to make sure are continually unblocked? These should be the attendees of the Leadership Team meeting. Do not add any other attendees to assuage their ego. They will just make the meeting less efficient.
For all the rest of your Department and Team Leads, there is a VPs (or Team Leads) Meeting. At this meeting, VPs announce recent decisions in the Leadership Meeting. There is then a ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment. If any of these decisions will have unintended consequences, now is the time for the VPS to raise their hand and say, ""That is a terrible idea for these reasons …"". The decision then gets kicked into a RAPID. But for the vast majority of decisions, the VPS will be okay with it, and then the decision gets published to the company, likely in All Hands.
To understand the scale of these meetings, I posit that the Leadership Team should be, and remain at, 6-8 people (up to 10 is okay). The VPs Meeting, by contrast, should grow as the company scales. At a company of 1,000 employees, the VPs Meeting often has 15-20 attendees. At Microsoft, this same meeting has over 150 attendees, or so I've been told.

Levels of Meetings
There are 3 levels of meetings based on how much pre-work (pre-reading and pre-writing) is needed prior to the meeting and how much work (sync reading and commenting) is needed during the meeting.


Meeting 1:
Prior to meeting
Nothing
During meeting
First 15 minutes,  I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 2:
Prior to meeting
I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting.
For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write.
Pre-meeting
I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.
During meeting
First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.


Meeting 3:
Prior to meeting

Brainstorming: written (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHmVPz0gVQqXctk5w2oKs8cQTLw6uprbPgQZaoO3HT0/edit#heading=h.nlpvf7hfrw7x ,"Brainstorming written (2 min)
One of the most powerful tools that I know of is co-writing. It allows ...
Sharing of much more information per minute than talking.
Everyone to share their ideas, even those who are quieter during verbal discussion.
People to feel heard and therefore buy-in to the decisions that eventually get made.
I encourage you to experiment with it one time. See the results. If you like them, continue.
To do so …
Step 1:  Collect everyone’s thoughts.
Open a shared Google Doc, Notion, Coda, ClickUp page, etc.
             
Pose a written question or request.


State the question or request verbally. 


This step may seem redundant, but neither written nor verbal presentation alone transmits the complete picture. Each transmits about half.  The written words are good at transmitting facts.  The spoken words are good at transmitting emotion and nuance.  


To get a full understanding, therefore, we need to ingest the information by both reading and hearing it.


Then ask everyone to write their thoughts on their private doc for 3-5 minutes and paste the final to the shared doc. 


This is so that the primary doc doesn't bounce around as people actively write in it at the same time.


Then take 5-10 minutes for everyone to ingest each other's thoughts. 


Ask everyone to +1 other people's thoughts when they agree so that you can visually see what the common sentiments are.


If there are less than 5-10 participants, you can ask each person to share their write-up verbally in 1 minute or less (be strict about time-keeping here!). 


If there are more than 5-10 participants, it will take too much time to allow all to speak their thoughts.  In this case, everyone simply reads the write-ups.


The facilitator or decision-maker can now ask clarifying questions of any person they want to understand more from, but they don't need to.


The first step is now complete. You have now collected a massive amount of information and made everyone on your team feel heard ... in less than 20 minutes!


CONGRATULATIONS!
Step 2:  The decision-maker takes the thoughts away, formulates a proposed solution asynchronously (which does not even need to include any of the thoughts garnered from the brainstorm) and returns at a future meeting to the group with the proposed solution in the Issue / Proposed Solution template.  All involved will feel that they at least got a chance to be heard before the proposed solution was formulated. 




Here is a way to go from problem identification all the way to solution:
Define the problem 
All participants to open a private Google Doc. Spend 5 minutes framing the issue.
Open a shared Google Doc. All copy-paste their definition into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite. Decision-maker to pick one. 


Propose the solution 
All participants spend 10 minutes writing their proposed solution in their private doc.        
All copy-paste their answer into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite. 

Decide 
Decision-maker spends 5-10 minutes asking clarifying questions.
Chooses a solution. 

Further questions 
If the Decision-Maker is not able to choose, she writes out a set of questions.
All to spend 10 minutes writing their answers to the questions.
All copy-paste their answers into the shared doc.
All read all entries. Vote on their favorite choice. Decision-maker picks one.


Async questions 
If the Decision-Maker is still not able to choose, she writes out another round of questions.
Adjourn decision to the following group meeting.
All to asynchronously write their answers to the questions and further proposed solutions.
All copy-paste their answers into the shared doc.
At the next meeting, all read all entries. Vote on their favorite choice. Decision-maker picks one.

Video of Francis Davidson (CEO of Sonder) explaining the Deconstructed Exec Team Meeting (15 min)
The Exec Team meeting is a place where the top leaders in the company come together to
Report on the status of all departments, goals, projects, etc
Unpack and solve issues that have arisen
Give each other feedback on behavior
When this meeting gets too large (over eight active participants), an efficient discussion is no longer possible. 
(Note: it is OK to have an unlimited number of observers as long as:
Observers indeed remain observers, i.e., they don't talk unless specifically asked to by the meeting owner.
Active participants don't tone down their comments because observers are present.)
When the number of team leads becomes too large, most companies split into an Exec Meeting and a Team Leads Meeting, as described in Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting (3 min). 
And while this structure is better than a huge meeting with way too many active participants, it does have a weakness. Updates on a project occur without the project lead present. Issues involving teams get decided on without those team leads present. How to solve this?
Francis Davidson at Sonder has figured out how: The ""deconstructed"" exec team meeting!
Here is how it works: Each function of the exec team meeting receives its own meeting (every 2-4 weeks) with the most relevant eight people present.
Each company goal has its own meeting bi-weekly, with the most relevant eight people present. If the company has three goals, this is three bi-weekly meetings. 
Each department has its business review monthly with the most relevant eight people present (and anyone is invited to observe). This is 6-10 monthly meetings.
Each major project has its own monthly review meeting, with the most relevant eight people present. 
At each of these meetings, the participants present (in writing and video in advance, of course, see Writing vs. Talking (and Video)) their wins, the status of their agreed-to actions, the issues and their proposed solutions, and their feedback for each other. Issues get decided. Feedback is processed. Actions get created.
There is no one overall Exec Team meeting. Just deconstructed sub-meetings.
Francis began this process in spring 2021. So far, the results are promising. I will give further updates as I hear them from Francis. 
Here is the complete write up from Sonder of the Sonder Leadership Team Management System.

After reading this write-up above, Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder: ""We still have a monthly all VP meeting where we review financials and summarize all decisions made in the last month. No video updates.""

Sonder, Reddit, and Bolt are now using this Deconstructed Exec Team Meeting method … with great success.

It is relatively easy to monitor a one-time task. Delegate it to someone, put it in a Task Tracker (ClickUp, Asana, Monday, etc.), and then check to see if and when it gets done.
But how to monitor a process? One with never-ending new tasks. Like a Recruiting firm meant to hire for a role. Or a Project or Business Unit's performance. Or the interaction between two tightly coupled Departments (i.e., Engineering and Product, or Sales and Marketing)
The answer is a regular Review Meeting.
For Recruiting, I schedule a 15-minute check-in once a week with the Recruiting firm where we look at the Candidate Pipeline (in a Google Sheet or Notion) and:
Debrief each candidate that I have met so far
Get briefed on each candidate that I have yet to meet
Write down the next Actions and DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each candidate
For a Project or Business Unit, I schedule a monthly 50-minute Review Meeting where the Project of Business Owner walks me through:
Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review and the results of those Actions
The current state of the Project/Business (Green, Yellow, Red), both 
the Good
the Issues the have come up, and their Proposed Solutions
What Actions do they plan to take in the next 30 days
For the interaction between two Departments that work closely together and, therefore, where there is often tension, rather than let that tension build into crisis, I schedule a monthly 80-minute Review where each Department head declares:
Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review
What has worked well in the partnership in the previous 30 days
What has not worked well, and a Proposed Solution to fix it
Together, we then decide on Actions
If you want to ensure that these meetings are as effective and efficient as possible, ask all participants to submit their updates to you in writing in advance. It is still important to hear them verbally present (because you can only hear emotional undertone verbally). Still, the presentation will be more information-rich and efficient if they have written it (and you have read it) ahead of time.

The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins) (By Celine Teoh),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_mOOt5qPPX5LrKCPmYz1S7KSMo-BGwRdHRISTDgFCk/edit?usp=sharing ,"The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins)
By Celine Teoh, Unicorn CEO Coach
Ever noticed how rare it is to hear “No” in your daily discussions? If you’re at the helm of a startup, that’s not just rare; it’s a red flag.
The Echo Chamber Issue
As a CEO, you’re often surrounded by agreement. This sounds great, but it’s a bubble. It’s like living in a false paradise where everything seems to be going smoothly, but beneath the surface, there are issues no one’s talking about. You’ve probably been blindsided by a project going south or an initiative flopping. And when you ask, “Why didn’t anyone tell me?”, you’re met with, “We saw it coming, but…”. This is the echo chamber in action. Speaking up, especially to challenge authority, isn’t always seen as safe.
Introducing the ‘Challenger’
What’s the fix? To start with: have a ‘Challenger’ in your team. This isn’t your typical naysayer. The Challenger’s role is crucial: they’re there to critically assess and voice concerns, to be the one who isn’t afraid to say “This might not work because…”. It’s about having that vital, often missing perspective.
Implementing the Challenger Role
The Challenger job is a tricky one. If someone gets locked into the role (“Oh, Kris is always the negative nay-sayer”), it does them no good because they lose credibility - everyone assumes they’re just saying no to say no. The solution here is to keep this role dynamic: rotate it among your team members. Today it’s Kris’s turn to be the skeptic, tomorrow it’s Lexie’s. This prevents anyone from being pigeonholed as the ‘negative one’ and keeps the feedback fresh and unbiased. Also, when junior team members take on this role, and their input is valued, it sets a powerful example – it says, “We’re all ears, no matter your position.”. Some tips:
Set Clear Expectations: Begin by clearly defining the Challenger role. Explain its purpose is to foster diverse viewpoints and robust discussion, not to oppose for the sake of opposition.
Regular Rotation: Implement a scheduled rotation for the Challenger role. This could be on a meeting-by-meeting basis or for a set period, like a week, to ensure everyone gets a turn.
Structured Feedback: During discussions, allocate specific times for the Challenger to present their viewpoints. This structured approach ensures the role is respected and integrated into the meeting flow.
Feedback Mechanism: After the Challenger speaks, encourage open discussion. This can be structured as a roundtable where each team member responds to the points raised, fostering a culture of open dialogue.
Support and Training: Provide support and training for team members taking on the Challenger role. This could include workshops on constructive criticism, conflict resolution, and effective communication.
Embed Challenging in Team Routine
Another approach is to weave this critical role into your team’s routine. After reaching a preliminary agreement, pause. Ask everyone to take five minutes to jot down potential issues or roadblocks privately, then go around the room and share. This way, you’re not singling anyone out – it’s just how you do things. By making the challenger role a structural one, everyone gets a moment to reflect and express concerns without personal risk. Tips:
Start with Why: At the beginning of each meeting, remind your team of the importance of critical thinking and diverse perspectives in driving innovation and avoiding blind spots.
Dedicated Critical Thinking Time: After initial agreement seems to be reached on an idea, pause and dedicate 5 minutes for solo critical thinking. Go around the room and share, or
Anonymous Feedback Option: Offer an anonymous feedback mechanism for team members who might feel hesitant to voice dissent openly. This could be a digital tool like Mentimeter.
Regular 'Devil’s Advocate' Sessions: Schedule regular sessions where the sole purpose is to challenge the status quo. These can be short, focused meetings where one or more team members are tasked with presenting counter arguments to current strategies or proposals.
Celebrate Diverse Viewpoints: Publicly acknowledge and celebrate when critical feedback leads to better decision-making or the avoidance of potential problems. This reinforces the value of the Challenger role and critical thinking in your team's culture.
Action Steps:
Start rotating a Challenger role in your team meetings.
Make it a part of your meeting process to collectively identify potential challenges to ideas.
Try these steps in your next meeting. They’re simple, yet they can profoundly shift how your team operates, ensuring that you’re not just hearing what you want to hear, but what you need to hear.

What other ways have you incorporated a challenger role into your teams?

Video of Emilie Choi (Coinbase President and COO) explaining RAPIDs and Biz Ops (20 min)
Getting Buy-In 
One of the core challenges in leadership is how to get your team to buy into a decision. It's often easy to decide, but it can be much harder to get your team to invest emotionally in that decision. 
You create buy-in when you make people feel they are part of the decision and that their input contributes to the outcome. The more influence they feel towards the outcome, the more invested they will be in the result.
Broadly, there are three ways to make a decision. Each has a different time requirement and creates different levels of buy-in. There are no free lunches here; unfortunately—the method that creates the most buy-in also takes the most time.
The methods are:
Method 1: Decision-Maker (see Type 1 vs. Type 2 below) makes the decision, announces it to the team, and answers questions.
Pro: Takes very little time.
Con: Creates minimal buy-in from the team and ignores benefits from their collective knowledge and experience. 
Method 2: Decision-Maker (or assigns someone) fosters a collaborative environment with the team. This process entails creating a written straw man (a hypothetical answer designed to inspire discussion), sharing it with the team, inviting the team to give feedback (written and verbal), facilitating group discussion, making everyone feel heard by repeating their comments, and coming to a decision.
Pro: Creates more buy-in and gets some minimal benefit from the collective wisdom of the team.
Con: Takes more time.
Method 3: Decision-Maker invites the team to meet and discuss the dilemma from scratch with no straw man using Brainstorming, structured (1min). Team shares ideas. Decision-maker repeats everyone's ideas until they feel heard. She shares her thoughts last because hers is the loudest voice in the room.
Decision-Maker then asynchronously creates her strawman (see #2 above) and shares it with the group for feedback. Decision-maker then makes the decision. Note: this is not a consensus decision. The decision-Maker creates the buy-in and confirms that she hears all ideas but ultimately does not accommodate all ideas.
Pro: Creates the most buy-in and gets a lot of benefit from the team's collective wisdom.
Con: Takes the most time.
Not surprisingly, the most significant benefits require the most work. If you want more buy-in and a better decision, you need to take more time making the decision.
So, which method should you use? It depends on the significance of the decision and the importance of the team's buy-in. For low-impact issues (e.g., the venue for the holiday party), Method 1 is sufficient. For major, core issues (e.g., Company 10-Year Vision, Company Goals, Product Roadmap), Method 3 is necessary. For everything in between (the vast majority of important decisions), Method 2 is optimal.
Issues and Proposed Solutions
Team members will often want to bring up an issue and discuss it verbally. This step is inefficient (listening takes longer than reading) and ineffective (only forward people speak up and get heard).
Instead, require that anyone who presents an issue at a team meeting do so in writing. The write-up should include both a detailed description of the Issue as well as their Proposed Solution. 
(I also like to include a section on “What I did to create this issue” just after the Issue description and before my Proposed Solution.  This makes others not feel blamed, and also usually points out a way that I can solve the issue on my own by unwinding the steps that I took to create it.)
The proposer may say, ""I don't know the answer."" It doesn't matter. Even if they only have 10% confidence in their answer, they should guess that their answer is the right one. And they should phrase the Proposed Solution in very bold, directive terms. (""Do this …."") This step may seem aggressive but creates a flag in the sand, which generates a highly productive discussion and quicker decision-time, which ultimately is more important than appearing to be humble.
I recommend that the team present all Issues and Proposed Solutions at the weekly Team Meeting. Allow up to 5 minutes of discussion for each tactical (short-term) Proposed Solution and as much as 20 minutes for each strategic (long-term) Proposed Solution. If the Decision-Maker feels that they have enough context to decide in that time, great. The decision-maker turns the Solution into a Next Action with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and Due Date.
If not, DO NOT spend more time talking about the Issue. Instead, turn to the RAPID framework described below.

IPS Flow Chart
Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions
In his iconic 2016 Shareholder Letter, Amazon's Jeff Bezos introduced us to light-weight, distributed decision-making. He wrote:
""Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren't like that – they are changeable, reversible – they're two-way doors. If you've made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. 
As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We'll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.""
Each time there is a decision to be made, rate it as Type 1 or Type 2. If Type 2, allow one of your reports to be the D (Decision-Maker in the RAPID process). Your report will make a faster decision, they will get the chance to exercise their decision-making muscle, and you will have the opportunity to gain confidence in their ability to make decisions well.
And note that, as Mike Vernal, Partner at Sequoia and former VP of Platform at Facebook, shared with me: ""Decisions are almost never Type 1.""
RAPID Decision-Making
Emilie Choi, President at Coinbase, introduced me to a tool developed by Bain Consulting to make fully-informed decisions with buy-in when:
A team has become too large to get all the needed voices in one room
A team cannot reach a consensus within 5-20 minutes of discussion
It is called RAPID. Here is an example of a RAPID. In this process:
The identifier of an issue or decision writes the following: 
The Issue
The Proposed Solution
The list of people required to make and implement the decision: 
R (Recommend) = the one who first proposed the Issue and Solution
A (Agree) = Include colleague whose input is vital to the decision 
This group is usually Legal, who are ensuring that no one is breaking the law!
P (Perform) = those people who will have to enact any decision and, therefore, should contribute
I (Input) = those people whose input is worth considering
D (Decide) = the one who will make the decision 
(See section below for an explanation of this Amazon modification.) 
If Type 1, this should be the CEO.
If Type 2, this should be someone other than the CEO.
Create a section on the document for each person to write their comments.
The R then reaches out to all the As, Ps, and Is to solicit their input. Once this input is received, the document is ready to be reviewed by the D.
The R schedules a Decision Meeting and invites the D, As, Is, and Ps. 
If the issue is urgent, the R schedules this Decision Meeting as soon as it needs to be.
If the issue is non-urgent, the R can use the next Team Meeting as the Decision Meeting. (This option is much more efficient and is best when the issue is non-urgent.)
At the Decision Meeting, the D reads through the document and asks any questions. If the participants can answer her questions in 5 minutes, she decides. If the team cannot answer in 5 minutes, she asks for another round of written responses on the document to answer her questions. At the next Team Meeting, she reviews these responses and decides.
Once the D decides, she writes up the Decision (or asks the R to do so) and all the Next Actions (each with a DRI and Due Date). The D then publishes this decision to the company.
Once a company starts this process, it is helpful to track all the RAPIDs that are in process and collect feedback on how to improve the process. For each of these, I recommend a doc:
Create a Sheet to track each RAPID (with a link to the RAPID document), which R and D are responsible for, when the Decision Meeting will take (or has taken) place, and finally, when the team completes all the Next Actions.


Create a Doc for Feedback (Like/Wish That) on the RAPID process. After each Decision Meeting, ask the participants to write their feedback until the process is working smoothly.

Why? Because a verbal presentation lets us know the emotions behind this write-up and the nuance that one can't fully capture in writing. 
Why not just a video, then? Because the writing creates the outline and is much easier to refer back to.
Why not just present the issue in a live meeting? You can. But then people cannot prepare for the meeting, nor can anyone who wasn't present at the meeting fully understand the issues. It takes the same amount of time to record a video as it does to present live, but the video can be shared much more efficiently and more pre-work done based on it.

6-18-18
Issue: OKR Anxiety. In the drafting of team OKRs, people kept coming back to fear of not achieving them. Communication of these being stretch goals likely wasn't clear. They're afraid they won't hit their OKRs, even though we have communicated that the OKRs are aspirational. People may think that you will grade them negatively if they don't hit their OKRs.
Selected feedback from ""when you think of fear and when they think of our OKRs, what comes to mind?""
""Many OKRs are inter-dependent, so I worry about systemic failure, e.g., SeqMatic also having trouble generating good RNA-seq data or having difficulty finding a suitable PD model in time for screening.""
""Fear that we base OKRs on experiments yielding hits and positive data, but there is no guarantee that the experiments will be successful. We can only realistically project that the experiments will be performed, which endpoints will be measured, and how many compounds can be screened in a given time frame.""
Solution:
Re-iterate to the team that OKRs are aspirational, and performance feedback will be given at 1:1s.
All managers will give a 0-10 grade during their 1:1s each week. Eight and above means you are performing well at the company and don't need to worry. Below eight means you are not hitting minimum/floor goals and need improvement. This way, people will know that they are achieving above the performance expectations even if there is uncertainty about the achievement of the actual OKR.
Decision
All managers gave one rating during 1:1 - you're doing well or needs improvement

Issue: Lab Move. The team feels stressed about achieving their OKRs given the pending lab move. Stressed out by company team-building events, they want to work. Lab move will interrupt a lot of their work. Feedback that we're underestimating the potential delays of the lab move. Uncertainty around the lab move. I don't want to burn people out. 
Solution:
Ben is now the owner of the lab move and will give weekly updates at the experimental meeting on the status of the lab move and answer any questions, write down issues, and present solutions in the following week. 
Present GANT chart timeline of when experiments will start/stop as part of the weekly update
Best case vs. mid-case vs. worst-case timelines will also be presented. 
Ben to put together the current state by next Thursday and where the most significant uncertainties.
Ideal outcome: Move-in equipment before we can move in people. Now it is all happening at once. Dates keep getting pushed back. 
More about expectations. When are we going to get experiments started again? 

Issue: Too many hires at once is causing lots of calendar cadence violations. Candidates have the best opportunity to meet all Company X employees on Thursdays, but candidates on site for Thursday forces calendar cadence violation. Jennifer needs to cancel all or most 1:1s on Thursdays to accommodate candidate interviews for every candidate. 
We've received feedback that the experimental team wants to meet every candidate. We've also received feedback that meetings are disruptive to the team. To adhere to calendar cadence, we need to choose one day for all candidate interviews. So, the team will have to choose (until January) between:
Candidate meeting days happen on the same day as the internal experimental meeting day (Thursday): the whole team can meet candidates, but 1:1s will be canceled every time a candidate visits, and scientists may have multiple internal meetings.
Candidate meeting days happen on separate days as internal meeting days: Scientists will only have one day of internal meetings, but the whole team won't meet every candidate unless they are interviewing them or attending dinner.
Proposed solution: We should prioritize scientists having uninterrupted days of bench time. As we grow, it will become impossible anyways to have everyone always meet every candidate. There is also significant overhead in re-scheduling meetings. Best to keep one consistent internal meeting day and one day where everyone knows there will be potential interviews for consistency - easier to plan experiments without changing dates. So change a different date for candidate interviews, not Thursday. Propose Tuesdays for candidates onsite. Team members who want to meet candidates can sign up in advance to participate in the interview process. This will keep calendar cadence. 
Steve: Tuesday
Fernando: Friday
Raj: Friday seems good. Wednesday and Thursday appear already too booked.
Fred: Not Thursday or Wednesday to violate calendar cadence, depending on the team/position. Is it necessary that the whole team meets every candidate for every position? The company is getting big now. Indeed, we want the people they will directly be working with to meet them & give feedback.
Alina: Friday, easier for candidate dinners for the team and allows people from MMRI/Mission bay to meet the candidate on their way back home if they are in the city
George: Upcoming computational job candidates are already scheduled for Thursdays. I vote for Thursdays (for computational job candidates) and Wednesdays for experimental candidates.
Tony: Monday or Friday or any day of the week to accommodate candidates who are employed. Only bring in candidates; we're 75% sure we want to extend an offer to cut down on visits. Ask the candidate to travel to multiple sites on the same day to accommodate Company X staff.
Erik: M-F is ok for me. It is not possible/necessary for every team member to meet every candidate. Any day of the week can work for me, but mornings > afternoons. Also, perhaps we need to screen candidates better to meet the ~75% threshold for offers.
Katherine: Tuesday. I agree that not every person needs to meet every candidate. 
Luke: Tuesday
Katherine: Friday. But please let's keep Monday and Tuesday completely free of meetings. 
Decision:
Candidate interview days on Friday for Experimental Team 
Susan will check with Matt about if OK to have two different days 
Report at next LT meeting 

Issue: Employees are sick and coming into the office, possibly making other team members sick. 
Solution: Emphasize a company policy that if you're sick, please work from home.
Company policy that all employees must stay home until 24 hours after they have been fever-free. Buy a thermometer.
If you have a fever, ask someone to cover for you 
Let the manager know if sick
VHS to send a message on Slack with the above policy - DONE

Issue: Lack of Clear Agreements Overall sense in most experimental projects, someone from the computational team will nebulously complete downstream analysis, but this is never accounted for explicitly in the project plan. Frequently, there is not an explicit agreement on when data needs to be delivered until too late. Then, lots of stress around ""hair on fire"" problems. We need a system for forming and tracking more straightforward agreements in advance. Too many owners on each project right now - we need one owner. 
Proposed solution: Require project proposals include explicit timelines that include the time required for all analyses, including computational analyses. All stakeholders in the project should agree and sign off on the project before the project launches. This would allow all the stakeholders to schedule their time upfront.
Use Labguru to schedule all analysis activities as part of the study. Includes wet lab and dry lab activities.
Whoever initiates the project is responsible for following through with the end deliverable on time and soliciting feedback and agreement on dates for each aspect of the project and analysis. 
Decision: accept the proposed solution.

Issue: Not Keeping Agreements. People are not keeping their agreements and timelines. People say yes to everything, even action items that are too ambitious, miss timelines. The consequence is that experiments are delayed or executed with incomplete analysis. I feel that people agree to items they don't have full body approval. Yet, there are few/little repercussions if agreements or deadlines aren't met regarding data analysis and deliverables. How do we avoid unanticipated hair-on-fire problems and distractions in the future?
Solution:
Start tracking completion rates of action items each person sets during accountability sections of 1:1s
These are weekly action items set by each person for themselves that are necessary to complete their goals
Make clear that the target is 100%
If continue to achieve < 100% completion of accountability during 1:1s, the manager lets them know needs improvement

Issue: 
Like the RAPID process and how it involves invested parties and solicits input from experts, at least for this round, started late and are halfway through the quarter, without completing team or individual OKRs. 
Proposed Solution: Moving forward should start sooner, so don't eat into the quarter before finalizing.
Action: Leadership team is working on scheduling planning for Q1 2019 OKRs before Christmas. - Done; meetings tentatively scheduled for the week of Dec. 17th.

Issue: 
Data management is driving me nuts. Currently, I'm trying to update the board deck and realizing I'm spending lots of time finding data. Not everything is updated on Google drive or Labguru, and I'm hopping around many places. Even the ""ALS data to date"" google slides aren't current with new data. Spend a lot of time digging in Slack for updated data and going to multiple places to find the data. 
Proposed solution: Set a date for labguru training. Start uploading all current studies on labguru. No more google doc or folders for lab data. Eventually integrate with web portal. Also include dates for studies and specific activities (i.e., cells plated, dosed, data ready for analysis, etc.). 
Discussion: Concern that some big data can't live in labguru. What about raw images?
Decision: Start putting as much data into labguru, and develop a separate policy for exceptions.
Raj, when he sees outdated slides, will let the presenter know. 
Fernando to send a calendar invite for LabGuru training.

Issue: 
People at the Bench need an unbroken time to suit up and do experiments from start to finish. Meetings sprinkled throughout the day causes significant disruption.


Proposed solution:
Calendar Cadence. For all non-managers at the company, incorporate two days of meetings and three days of NO meeting time. Circulate this as a company policy. Even on meeting days, there still needs to be lab time.

Issue:
Create a system for decisions and buy-in. Document and circulate the outcome of the decision.


Proposed Solution:
Team to read Decision-making
Issue/Proposed Solution, if no consensus, then 
RAPID

Issue:
Wish that there was more context around this whole exercise. Everything was a brief introduction. What is the premise, goal?


Proposed Solution:
Matt to give full intro and context at All Hands


Issue: 
Susan's time management. A lot of our 1-1s got changed at the last meeting. Happens more often than not. When these changes occur, it forces me to rejigger my entire schedule—during the Series A, meeting with different firms. There wasn't enough prep time to gather the info—a lot of fire drills.


Proposed Solution:
Calendar Cadence.
Susan to hold meeting agreements.


Issue: 
We have aggressive timelines. Ambition is great. Sometimes, we don't have a sense of realism, both in workload, resources, time, etc. Many variables are out of our control or we don't even know about. Things go wrong much more often than can be predicted.
However, from the company's perspective, achieving more significant milestones (such as a development candidate by our Series B) is critical to our survival. The question is, how can we create a system that allows for things to go wrong but allows us to stay on track for our larger milestones?


Proposed solution:
In plan, incorporate a 10% buffer for unexpected issues to come up in the lab. [ideas for how to include this buffer, practically speaking?] 
The long-term timeline to get to Series B must stay.
However, the path to get there can have a buffer as long as it is still on target.
Rank-order all OKRs. Focus on the top OKRs. Tighter timelines on the higher priorities. Require feedback on 4Q OKRs
Decision:
Team to read Decision-making for buy-in.
Create more buy-in for the OKRs by: 
Getting feedback from every single scientist first.
Susan, Jennifer, and George to share clearly 
Why each OKR is clearly needed for the company to succeed in its mission
OKRs are aspirational and will not be used for performance measurement
Weekly feedback (Like-Wish That) feedback will be given to each team member 
If each Team Member acts on the Wish That feedback, that will be the basis for positive performance measurement. 
Therefore, floor OKRs are not needed right now.

Agreement-Tracker:  why you need one (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzGvP6MrmlD6YVilTiNjEsPgRRvjzvWrqGXKSz_c68k/edit ,"Agreement-Tracker:  why you need one (3 min)

How to use Asana as an Agreement Tracker: Easy, Medium, Expert levels (by Regina Gerbeaux, CoS to Matt Mochary)
When you are in a small group (less than 20 people in one office space), you don't need a system of sharing information because everyone in the group can literally hear each other. All team members can grok the CEO's priorities. And the CEO groks the obstacles that the teammates are encountering.
But once you can no longer physically hear each other talk (i.e., when you are working remotely even if less than 20 people, or you are in person but more than 20 people), then there is no way to overhear those priorities and obstacles. Now you need to create a structured system of information flow. If you do not, team members will not work on the highest priority tasks, and the CEO will not unblock the team members. The system must be written (otherwise, the details cannot be shared with those that happened not to be present for the physical conversation), and agreements (i.e., actions that I have agreed to do) must be tracked to completion. 
People sometimes use a Google Doc or Sheet to track agreements for a particular meeting (a 1-1 or team meeting). This step has limited value because these Docs then proliferate, and each team member has tasks listed across many docs, which is impractical for them to track.
For an agreement-tracker to be effective, each person must have only one location where they need to look to see all the actions they have agreed to do. This is precisely why action-trackers like Monday.com and Asana were created. They have overhead (i.e., it takes more time to write down an action in Asana than it does to write it on an individual notepad), so it should only be used for actions where you have agreed with someone else (i.e., your manager, your teammates, etc.) that you will do that action. 
I recommend using a lower overhead tool like an individual electronic notepad for actions only on your own to-do list.
When implementing an agreement-tracker in your company, there are a few best practices to follow:
Start using it yourself first so that you are familiar with it. 
Then start using it in your 1-1s with your direct reports. It will be more overhead than using a Google Doc, but this is simply a stepping stone to the next step. Let it sit here for a few meetings until each report is using the tool correctly. 
Then start using it in your team meeting. Let it sit here for a few meetings until all see the value of it. 
This action is where it will become powerful. Now each team member will see just how much each other team member is getting done. 
This transparency will instantly boost morale. Because up until now, each member doubted that any other member was actually doing any work at all. Each person thought they were the only one doing actual work and questioned whether they should continue to be the chump. (i.e., morale was falling)
Then require your directs to start using it with their 1-1s, and eventually in their team meetings.
Continue to require that the tool get cascaded down until everyone in the company is using it.
There is one exception to this usage. Engineering departments often prefer to use a more technical action-tracker like Jira. (Although I know plenty of engineering departments that use Asana and love it.) If your engineering department prefers Jira, that is fine. Allow them to use it and not be on the rest-of-the-company system.
When I came into a company and was the 1-day-a-week CEO to implement my management system, I always implemented this action-tracking tool (usually Asana). I did it at Clearbit, Angellist, Bolt, etc. It worked magically.
Then I started coaching bigger companies. When I suggested this tool, I got push-back (usually from the older VPs on the executive team, who I think didn't want to learn a new tool). Their excuse was always similar: ""Matt, those companies you mentioned are all less than 150 people. But we're over 1,000 people. There is no way that we could impose a universal tool here."" 
I am not interested in forcing people, so I didn't. 
Until I started coaching Francis Davidson at Sonder … with 1300 employees … all on Asana. And the company operated better than any of the others that I coached with more than a few hundred employees. I finally had the example that I needed!
So, now that you are working remotely, and even when you return in person one day, use an action-tracking tool throughout the entire company. Agreed-upon actions will actually get done, everyone will be able to see that clearly, and morale will soar … creating an upward spiral of productivity. 
Note on Asana: 
If you choose to use Asana, there are several rules that you need to follow to achieve success:
Train people on how to use it before you ask them to use it for work. This training needs to be nothing more than a 15-minute session. 
Identify the most Asana-knowledgeable person in the company. 
Ask that person to write a list of all the useful Asana actions.
Schedule a team training session 
The trainer shows how to perform the first action on a screen visible to all.
All participants perform that same action on their screen.
If any participant gets stuck, they can ask their neighbor or the trainer for help.
Repeat for all the actions on the list.
Suggest that people put individual tasks (i.e., those they do not have to agree with someone else) in an individual task-manager (like Evernote, Omnifocus, Things3, etc.), not Asana. Once Asana gets populated with too many tasks, recognizing the actual priority actions becomes overwhelming and difficult. Only if someone becomes very comfortable with Asana should they attempt to use it as their sole task manager.
Never blindly assign someone a task in Asana. Only use Asana to log agreements already made (i.e., the person agreed to do the action). An easy way to ensure this: Only the action-doer is the person who writes the task in Asana. They will never write something that they didn't agree to.

There are many tools that can effectively be used as agreement trackers.  ClickUp, Monday.com, Asana, Height, Coda, Notion.  Each have their pros and cons.  I recommend that you test each before choosing one.

DRIs:  Directly-Responsible Individuals (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit ,"DRIs:  Directly-Responsible Individuals (3 min)

""We have many projects and metrics that no one is directly responsible for … and therefore, we get neither reporting nor action on them.""
If you run your company with actions, projects, goals (OKRs), and decisions, you also need DRI - Directly-Responsible Individuals.
You likely already know this for actions. It's pretty clear that if something needs to get done, someone needs to do it. Stating: ""One of you, please get this done.""… will result in no one doing the task. There clearly needs to be one named person, a due date, and a way to later check if that person actually completed the task, i.e., through an Agreement-Tracker: why you need one (3 min).
So, a DRI is needed for an action to get done and reported on.
In the same way, you need a DRI for every:
Metric
Goal
Project
Meeting
Decision
This DRI is responsible for reporting status as well as pushing toward the goal line.
Every metric, OKR, and project in the company should be listed, along with the DRI and a reporting cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly). All reporting should be written and attached to this tracking document. Those reports can also be given verbally at Meetings: Reviews (Pipeline, Project/Business Unit, Cross-Departments). But even if you present verbally, these reports should still be written and maintained in a public place for all to refer to at any time. 
The pushback that I regularly hear:
""Yes, but who should the DRI be? If we make it someone junior, they don't have the authority to compel people to action. And the senior people are all already overloaded."" 


My answer:
 
Someone as DRI is better than no one, even if that person doesn't have full authority to influence. If they cannot influence, they can Clean Escalate to the Apex Manager, who has full authority (i.e., they can fire/hire).


""DRIs will be laser-focused on gathering resources for their project, metric, goal, etc. They will over-optimize for their particular responsibility, and not think about what's best overall for the company, leading to a suboptimal result."" 


My answer: 


This is indeed a problem. But the much bigger problem is the apathy that comes along without DRIs. 


And you can address this problem through Clean Escalations from those who get needed resources pulled away. 


""If we make a junior person the DRI, they will make decisions without enough context, and those decisions won't be good ones."" 


My answer:


The DRI needs to report regularly in a review: 


What they did


The current status


What they plan to do


Their Manager is, therefore, the Decision-Maker on overall direction. 


This is akin to a Recruiter that you hire. 


The Recruiter is the DRI responsible for finding great candidates and helping to close the one you like. 


But you, as Hiring Manager, are the decision-maker who decides which candidate to make an offer to.
When it comes to Projects, please consider the following:
Do not allocate resources until the project's intended impact is defined and a DRI assigned. This action will cause short-term pain (projects taking a few days longer to get started) but long-term joy (no orphans).
Beware of a proliferation of projects that continue to live even when they should die. You will need to look at, and be ruthless about, projects regularly. Kill all the ones that no longer are high priority or are not succeeding. 
Pick a cadence for project reporting (likely monthly), as well as a cadence for the live/die decision (likely quarterly).

Clean Escalate (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDxWPYirGOvs1MxdCkI98U-_7lNjr_b10jclR_D-laQ/edit ,"Clean Escalate (2 min)

""People come to me all the time and complain about others in the company. What do I do?""
Departments need to work collaboratively to get things done. Sales and Marketing must work together to both generate and then close leads. Product and Engineering must work together to understand customer problems and then build the features to solve those problems.
But what if Marketing feels that Sales is squandering the leads that they are giving them? 
What if Product feels that Engineering ignores the product roadmap and builds whatever seems fun to build? 
The Head of Marketing can't hire/fire the Head of Sales. The Head of Product can't hire/fire the Head of Engineering. 
Instead, in frustration, the Head of Marketing will come to you, the CEO, and complain about the Head of Sales and demand that you rectify the problem. This action is a ""dirty escalation."" Escalation because they have escalated the issue up the org chart to you. Dirty because you are only hearing one side of the story.
It is fine to escalate, but the key is to do so cleanly. Clean would be if you, as Apex Manager, received a well-prepared presentation from each side at the same time so that you could make a well-informed decision. 
(An Apex Manager is the manager that has fire/hire authority over both people involved in a disagreement. Often this is the CEO, but not always.)
The following is how Clean Escalation works in practice:
Head of Marketing (HoM) has a problem with the Head of Sales (HoS).


HoM first goes to HoS and clearly states the problem that she is experiencing and her proposed solution. 
If the two agree on a solution, nothing more needs to be done.


If the two cannot agree on a solution, then they agree to do a Clean Escalation to their Apex Manager. Together, they reach out to their Apex Manager jointly and ask for a meeting.


HoM and HoS prepare their positions in writing and submit them to the Apex Manager before the meeting.


At the meeting, all read both documents. Apex Manager asks questions until she feels that she has enough context and then makes a decision. 


It is OK for Apex Manager to ask for a mulligan. 


I.e., ""I need more information."" If this happens, then …
Apex Manager must list out exactly what information she needs and who will collect that information.
The manager sets a new meeting time. Materials are written and submitted in advance. 
At this second meeting, the Apex Manager makes a decision. No more mulligans!
To ensure that clean escalations occur, you, as Apex Manager, must say ""no"" to all dirty escalations. Once you do, your company and your life will become cleaner!"
Lord of the Flies (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFeiiqbU0-T8wkvNAU9LG2WA-yrl9vomLkcrZfQZTqk/edit# ,"Lord of the Flies (1 min)

Inevitably, conflict arises in any organization. When it does, it is up to you to teach your team members how to give and receive non-violent feedback and ensure that they do.
Many managers do not enjoy dealing with people in conflict, and therefore instead say, ""You two, work it out amongst yourselves."" But unless your team is already proficient at non-violent communication and radical candor, then the two will likely not be able to work it out on their own. If you continue to stay at arms-length, the result will be … Lord of the Flies. The absence of governance leads to civil war. This is not healthy.
To stop this behavior, you must step in to adjudicate when your team members cannot work it out on their own. Give them one chance to do so. If they cannot, then step in to decide the issue or mediate the conflict. If you don't want to do it yourself, hire a coach to teach and facilitate the feedback sessions. Whatever you do, do not simply leave the participants on their own to work it out. If you do, you will be responsible for the emotional bloodshed that ensues.

Loudest voice in the room (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKJnyxUZDOcPQF0VtERizzyvKgBiqwOA7aL2dMcFSdw/edit ,"Loudest voice in the room (1 min)
(This writing was inspired by a conversation with Anthony Ghosn, CEO of Shogun.)
Whenever you choose to use Method 3 to get full buy-in, know that, as CEO, your voice will be the ""loudest in the room."" To get full buy-in, you will have to elicit people's most genuine thoughts. Once people hear your perspective, some percentage will naturally alter their views to more closely match yours. This % is much higher than you might imagine. People assume that as CEO, you have more information than they do, and therefore your perspective is probably more correct. Later, these same people will not feel fully bought-in to the outcome, because internally they will know that their true thought was not heard. 
So, to get the full benefit of your team's knowledge and make sure that they get to full buy-in, be careful not to ""tip your hand"" before all others have shared theirs. The most effective way to do this is to either have people write down their vote or thoughts before you share your perspective. Or by having everyone give a simultaneous thumbs-up/thumbs-down vote.
For an excellent example of this phenomenon and the solution, CJ Reim of Amity Ventures pointed me to 13 Days by Robert F Kennedy about the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins) (By Celine Teoh),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_mOOt5qPPX5LrKCPmYz1S7KSMo-BGwRdHRISTDgFCk/edit?usp=sharing ,"The Essential ‘Challenger’ Role on Your Team (3 mins)
By Celine Teoh, Unicorn CEO Coach
Ever noticed how rare it is to hear “No” in your daily discussions? If you’re at the helm of a startup, that’s not just rare; it’s a red flag.
The Echo Chamber Issue
As a CEO, you’re often surrounded by agreement. This sounds great, but it’s a bubble. It’s like living in a false paradise where everything seems to be going smoothly, but beneath the surface, there are issues no one’s talking about. You’ve probably been blindsided by a project going south or an initiative flopping. And when you ask, “Why didn’t anyone tell me?”, you’re met with, “We saw it coming, but…”. This is the echo chamber in action. Speaking up, especially to challenge authority, isn’t always seen as safe.
Introducing the ‘Challenger’
What’s the fix? To start with: have a ‘Challenger’ in your team. This isn’t your typical naysayer. The Challenger’s role is crucial: they’re there to critically assess and voice concerns, to be the one who isn’t afraid to say “This might not work because…”. It’s about having that vital, often missing perspective.
Implementing the Challenger Role
The Challenger job is a tricky one. If someone gets locked into the role (“Oh, Kris is always the negative nay-sayer”), it does them no good because they lose credibility - everyone assumes they’re just saying no to say no. The solution here is to keep this role dynamic: rotate it among your team members. Today it’s Kris’s turn to be the skeptic, tomorrow it’s Lexie’s. This prevents anyone from being pigeonholed as the ‘negative one’ and keeps the feedback fresh and unbiased. Also, when junior team members take on this role, and their input is valued, it sets a powerful example – it says, “We’re all ears, no matter your position.”. Some tips:
Set Clear Expectations: Begin by clearly defining the Challenger role. Explain its purpose is to foster diverse viewpoints and robust discussion, not to oppose for the sake of opposition.
Regular Rotation: Implement a scheduled rotation for the Challenger role. This could be on a meeting-by-meeting basis or for a set period, like a week, to ensure everyone gets a turn.
Structured Feedback: During discussions, allocate specific times for the Challenger to present their viewpoints. This structured approach ensures the role is respected and integrated into the meeting flow.
Feedback Mechanism: After the Challenger speaks, encourage open discussion. This can be structured as a roundtable where each team member responds to the points raised, fostering a culture of open dialogue.
Support and Training: Provide support and training for team members taking on the Challenger role. This could include workshops on constructive criticism, conflict resolution, and effective communication.
Embed Challenging in Team Routine
Another approach is to weave this critical role into your team’s routine. After reaching a preliminary agreement, pause. Ask everyone to take five minutes to jot down potential issues or roadblocks privately, then go around the room and share. This way, you’re not singling anyone out – it’s just how you do things. By making the challenger role a structural one, everyone gets a moment to reflect and express concerns without personal risk. Tips:
Start with Why: At the beginning of each meeting, remind your team of the importance of critical thinking and diverse perspectives in driving innovation and avoiding blind spots.
Dedicated Critical Thinking Time: After initial agreement seems to be reached on an idea, pause and dedicate 5 minutes for solo critical thinking. Go around the room and share, or
Anonymous Feedback Option: Offer an anonymous feedback mechanism for team members who might feel hesitant to voice dissent openly. This could be a digital tool like Mentimeter.
Regular 'Devil’s Advocate' Sessions: Schedule regular sessions where the sole purpose is to challenge the status quo. These can be short, focused meetings where one or more team members are tasked with presenting counter arguments to current strategies or proposals.
Celebrate Diverse Viewpoints: Publicly acknowledge and celebrate when critical feedback leads to better decision-making or the avoidance of potential problems. This reinforces the value of the Challenger role and critical thinking in your team's culture.
Action Steps:
Start rotating a Challenger role in your team meetings.
Make it a part of your meeting process to collectively identify potential challenges to ideas.
Try these steps in your next meeting. They’re simple, yet they can profoundly shift how your team operates, ensuring that you’re not just hearing what you want to hear, but what you need to hear.

What other ways have you incorporated a challenger role into your teams?

Example:  [PUBLIC] Mochary Method - Vision 2031
Mission
A mission should state the purpose of the company in one simple, short and memorable sentence. To do this, I like to answer the following question in as few words as possible:
Our purpose is to do what for whom?

Vision
A vision is simply a prediction of what the company will look like far on the horizon once it has achieved massive success. This can take many forms. But I like to keep it as short as possible (so that it is memorable) while also reinforcing key components. To me, those components are: 
Customer
Problem
Solution
Moat
Therefore, to create the ten-year vision, I imagine it is ten years from now. We are the dominant company in the industry. I ask myself:
What industry do we dominate?
Who is our customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
What pain do they have that we're solving for them?
What is unique about our solution that causes the customer to choose us over the competition?
What asset (human or physical) do we control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy our solution? In other words, what is our moat?

Values
There are many ways to create company values. Values should clearly define the behaviors that you want all team members to exhibit. Once created, you should hire for these behaviors and fire those unwilling to do these behaviors.
Here are two ways to determine what those behaviors are.
A simple one is to complete the following sentence: ""The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you …."" This is appropriate when the company is small, and values are entirely aspirational.

Another version is to acknowledge the culture that you already have. To do this, use a Brainstorming: written session to 
Ask each Leadership Team member to write down several examples of a person in the company who is NOT on the Leadership Team and exhibits a behavior that they wish would be a universal behavior. Name the person and the behavior. 
Of all the examples given, select 3-5.  
These are now your values (with real examples!). 
This method is best used when the company already has a sizable team and existing culture.

Mission 
A mission should state the purpose of the company in one simple, short and memorable sentence. To do this, I like to answer the following question in as few words as possible:
Our purpose is to do what for whom?
We exist to make running a fast-scaling company both easy and effective by turning all managers into great managers.  
Vision (2031)
What industry do we dominate?
Company operating system software  (eg- Workday).


Who is our customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)?
Brian Long, CEO of Attentive Mobile


What pain do they have that we're solving for them?
Brian cannot effectively train his managers to be good managers.  He cannot get them to follow a structure in their 1-1s and team meetings, nor does he know what content his managers’ team members are sharing in those 1-1s and team meetings.  Beyond that, he doesn’t have the bandwidth to show them how to give and get feedback well, make people feel heard and create buy-in for decisions, hold a high bar for performance and actually let go of decent performers, resolve conflict, create trust and like amongst peers, set a clear roadmap, hold the team accountable to all agreements, etc.

What is unique about our solution that causes the customer to choose us over the competition?
Our solution is unique because it teaches a very opinionated method that already has buy-in from the CEO.  
Show every action, issue (and decision), piece of feedback, answer to magic questions, OKR → functionality.  
It’s easy to use.  
Manager training for 1,000s.
It tells you how to run a meeting, conflict resolution, fire well, etc.


What asset (human or physical) do we control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy our solution? In other words, what is our moat?

Values
We have fun.  We understand that fear is a powerful motivator for work, but joy is an even better motivator.  As a result, we seek to enjoy the work we do, but we also understand that in order to do our best work, we are responsible for creating joyful lives outside of work, too.
Gabe organizes a group social with friends once a week.  Sometimes it’s trivia night at a bar.  Sometimes it’s just a hangout.  But he proactively creates for himself the in-person gatherings that are absent in a remote work environment. 
We believe in radical candor.  This means we see feedback as a gift, and withholding feedback means we prevent our teammates from having the chance at improving.  We ask each other to inform us when we are in fear or anger, and therefore not making the best decisions.  We choose to get curious and ask for clarification of our teammates’ intentions, words, and actions when we feel fear or anger, rather than jumping to conclusions.
Nikita, without fear, gives everyone his transparent feedback of how they could improve.  On the receiving end, he solicits feedback from others, and views each bit that he gets as positive guidance. 
We believe in freedom and responsibility.  Just like Netflix trusts their employees to make decisions in the company’s best interest, we do the same.  We agree to be good stewards of the resources and responsibilities we are given.
Case has given Phelipe the authority to decide what product we should be building, because Phelipe has more information about customers’ pain points as well as other tools in the marketplace.
We are individually organized.  We agree to keep our own tasks clean using GTD so nothing important gets dropped.  In order to enable our team to do its best work, we all abide by an Agreement-Tracker to maintain visibility and task transparency at all times.
Trishia diligently puts all of her actions into the company action-tracker (currently CompanyOS).  
We create an environment of trust.  Brené Brown outlines this using the BRAVING acronym, and we agree to abide by this framework.

"Budgeting (2 min reading, 12 min video)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WsABnJuOqmP1ACIMiu5khXQnOGwklndjDPdVyRSWb8/edit ,"Budgeting (2 min)
""Financial planning is a huge pain right now. We have raised a lot of money, but we just seem to burn more money, and a lot of people are coming to the well asking for even more resources. The big issue is that I don't feel like we have any infrastructure in place to measure the ROI of the marginal investments that we make.  All of the execs want to be investing a lot, and I want to be more measured, and I feel like I'm an army of one pushing for more thoughtfulness.""
Sound familiar? If yes, you are not alone. And there are answers.
One effective method is market-based budgeting, where market is determined by looking at the P&Ls of comparable public companies.  Once you have the % of revenue that the comparables spend in each department, then you follow these steps:
Project revenue for the coming year.


Go to Sales and ask what resources they need to achieve that revenue.  If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.


Then go to Product and Engineering and ask what are the critical resources they need to build the key features on the Product Roadmap that will enable the projected revenue.  If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.


For the remaining departments, they are given a $ number based on the comparables.  (Brian Long of Attentive Mobile calls each of these budgets an “envelope”.)


The envelope should be an amount of $, not headcount.  If headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people.


Here is a video of Brian Long, CEO of Attentive Mobile, explaining the market-based budgeting system (12 minutes).  


Another method that Amazon has effectively used is the investment (outcomes-based) model. If people want an allocation of $, they must pitch for it, just as a founder would pitch an investment firm. The pitch must include projections of what results can be produced with the dollars. If the decision-maker is compelled, she will allocate the capital. But then there is a cadence of reporting (usually monthly check-ins) wherein the recipient of the capital must report on their progress (OKRs) and metrics (KPIs). Borrowing from the Bridgewater Associates model, people get scored on their ability to deliver their projected ROI. Those with higher scores get further access to capital. 
It is essential to do so in dollars when making allocations, not headcount, even though the dollars are primarily used for headcount. Why? Because if you use headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people. If their allocation is in dollars, however, they will optimize for output.
There are, however, several problems with the outcomes-based system.  Here are two:
When the outcomes don’t materialize, department heads begin to blame others in the org, because there is always some kind of dependency.   And it is difficult to hold department heads accountable, because the only meaningful consequence is letting them go, and that is often beyond what you want to do (and they know it).


It takes several iterations (and each iteration is a year if budgeting is annual) to get a meaningful score on a department head.

OKR Creation (6 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoiH4pwsph5rwSM_wMMiMJkX6-qFVwO0SVYkodNZhwg/edit ,"OKRs (6 min)
For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3. Three Objectives, with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs). 
(Warning: A common mistake is to create Department OKRs, without creating Company-level OKRs. This omission leads to silo-ed fiefdoms that do not work together nor trust each other.)
The Objective (O) answers the question: ""Where do we want to go?"". This objective should tell a compelling story akin to the tagline of a Hollywood movie. It does not need to be measurable (i.e., ironically, it can be subjective). But it should be inspiring.
Key Results (KRs) answer the question: ""How do we know that we're getting there?"" KRs should be objectively measurable. 
Here are examples:
Objective: Massively grow revenues.
Key Results- 
$500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) [metric that lets us know we've gotten to the desired result]
Hire ten additional SDRs. [step needed to get to the result]
Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team. [action required to get to the result]
Company OKRs should be broad enough to encompass the whole company so that each department and team can feel that their work contributes to at least one of its priorities. Typical company-level OKRs include:
Profits: Massively grow revenues while minimizing expense
Product: Delight our customers
People: Create a positive and transparent environment where we are all inspired to do our best work
Forming OKRs
At the end of every quarter, gather the leadership team and collaborate on the coming quarter's OKRs. I've found the process that gets the best results, and most buy-in is to ask every member of your leadership team to separately write up what they think the global OKRs of the company should be. Then combine the ideas of everyone into one document. You will see common themes and have a healthy debate about the company's priorities. But in the end, you are the Decision-Maker, and you must choose what the company's OKRs are. This is not an exercise in consensus, just in hearing people out.
The critical thing to keep in mind when forming OKRs is that they are clearly defined and measurable so a third party can adjudicate whether or not they were completed. 
Once your leadership team has come up with the company's OKRs, share them with the broader team and instruct each department head to perform the same process within their department and then at the individual level during one-on-ones. 
Keep in mind that each person should develop their OKRs (that align with the company's) rather than you dictating each person's OKRs. That way, each person feels personally invested in their OKRs and has 'buy-in.'
The OKR creation process is usually a distracting one. Therefore, keep it to one week or less if at all possible. Make this an Admin Week, and do all the other required quarterly admin processes (last quarter's OKR de-brief, performance management, etc.) during that same week.
Here is a potential timeline for OKR creation during Admin Week:
Timeline
Monday. 
Leadership Team meeting (with all Department Heads). 2 hours to create company OKRs using Structured brainstorming. 
Tuesday. 
Each department has a group meeting (2 hours) to create department OKRs. CEO to check and approve all department OKRs by the end of the day.
Wednesday. 
Each team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create team OKRs. Department head to check and approve all team OKRs by the end of the day.
Thursday. 
Each sub-team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create sub-team OKRs. The team head to check and approve all sub-team OKRs by the end of the day.
Friday. 
Each individual creates individual OKRs. Sub-team head to review and approve all individual OKRs by the end of the day.
Monday. 
At the Leadership Team meeting, the CEO checks and approves all OKRs. Announce all OKRs to the company at All Hands.
Tracking OKRs
Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Google Sheet or Notion page. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an example.
Prompt the leadership team to update the status of their OKRs (on-track, lagging, poor) as part of the one-on-one process, and ask your managers to do likewise.
All OKRs that are far off-track require that the DRI (directly responsible individual) create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.

The above method works well for a company of fewer than 100 people. If you are over 100, you will have to tweak the process a bit.

Magic Questions (1 min)

First, read Praise (3 min)
In addition to those techniques, I recommend coaching each team member to help them achieve an environment that allows them to feel joy and therefore produce their best work.
I ask my reports the following sets of questions once a month in our 1-1, where 1 is ""it couldn't be any worse,"" 5 is ""it couldn't be any better,"" and 3 is ""meeting expectation"":
How are you feeling about your life at work, 1-5?
What is your 5 year career vision?
Is what you are doing now at work leading you toward your 5 year career vision, 1-5?
How are you feeling about your personal life, 1-5?
How are you feeling about your Work From Home (WFH) setup, 1-5?
How are we performing as a company, 1-5?
What is it like to work with the rest of the team, 1-5?
What is it like to work with me, 1-5?


For the lowest category …
What would get it to the next level?


If unpacking personal life, please rate these categories, 1-5:

Mind and Soul


For the lowest category …
What would get it to the next level?
I read through the entire list.  To improve Work Life, Personal Life, WFH and “Work with the rest of the team” usually require actions from the person.  So, from these categories, I pick the lowest rated one.  I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I help them formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level.  I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker.  (I usually don’t unpack a second category, unless it feels that the person has the capacity to handle more tasks.)
I then pick the lowest rated category among the remaining:  Company Performance and “Working with me”, as those usually require actions from me.   I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I ask them to help me formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level.  I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker.  

I ask these same questions (in writing) once per month for each team member.  Over time, each will rise until all are 4 or above.  And then magic usually happens.  
Even if I don't succeed in creating a perfect 5 environment, my team feels very heard and cared for, simply because I ask the questions and cause them to think about it.  In particular, the question about personal life (""How are you feeling about your life overall, 1-5?"") seems to unlock a lot of joy, which in turn boosts workplace productivity and loyalty. People feel honored that I care enough about them to help them tangibly improve their personal life.
For those team members who have high variability in motivation, I ask a further set of questions:
On your list of actions, what are you excited to work on?
On your list of actions, what are you not excited to work on?
For the actions that they are excited about, nothing needs to be done. They will crush those.
For each action that they are not excited about, I ask them which bucket it falls into:
Doesn't need to be done


Needs to be done, but someone else can do it. 


Who could do it?


Needs to be done, and only you can do it. 


What conditions would make it pleasant for you to do it? i.e., You would enjoy doing this action as long as … 


One trick that often works to make an unpleasant task less unpleasant is to do the task while co-working with someone else. So, I offer to have a co-working session with them. I work on the actions that I don't relish but am the only one who can do them. They work on their similar set. I find that we both get a lot done without feeling any pain. This is an Accountability Partner (1 min).
I have found that it only takes a few months for each team member to start answering 4/5 (most people hold back on giving a 5 because things could always be better, even if they don't know how) about their work life, their home life, how we are operating as a company, and my interaction with them. And when that happens, their productivity shoots through the roof. 
When I take the next step and make sure that each person works primarily on things that excite them, the fireworks begin.
Suddenly, a very small team can produce an immense amount of work. And the benefits of that … well, hopefully, you already know.

Praise (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFhFbtIxmUdrUe9y341ghd-EJ89hJZ7g9tOKnw16FI/edit ,"Praise (3 min)
Motivation is a tricky thing. If you're a CEO or Manager, how do you create it in your team members? How do you maintain it?
Luckily, most people arrive in a job or a relationship with lots of motivation. So, your only job is to help them maintain it. 
Jordan Petersen observes that if someone does something willfully or intentionally to break the rules or not meet the standards of performance, and you call them out on it, they almost feel relief. They know that they didn't perform, and it's almost comforting to know that you noticed. You haven't hurt the person. 
By contrast, if you want to hurt somebody, find someone earnestly trying and chastise them for something they didn't do as you wanted. You will crush them. 
Now, of course, none of us wants to hurt anybody nor crush their motivation. The key then is to realize that nearly EVERYONE around us is trying. Our team members, our spouse, our kids, our parents, and our siblings. Nearly EVERYONE.
Treat them as such. 
Right now, you are likely thinking: ""So, how do I get them to do what I want if I can't point out what they're doing wrong?"" 
Do the inverse. Point out what they are doing right!!! Thank them for it. ""Thank you for doing …."" Describe a specific action that they did, not a general personality trait. 
Good: 
""Thank you for sending out all the board materials one week before the board meeting."" 
""Thank you for doing the dishes last night.""
Not good: 
""Thank you for being so conscientious."" 
""Thank you for being so helpful.""
It may seem simple. But it's potent.
Every time you notice them doing something right, point it out. They will glow with satisfaction that you noticed what they did and that they are trying. Then they will be eager to do even more that is positive. They may even ask you what else they can do. But even if they don't, they will continue to do that one thing that you praised.
As time goes on, notice and praise other things. You are giving them confidence and motivation. Very quickly, you will see their overall performance improve.
And note that these praisings do not have to be lengthy nor in person. You can send a text. It often takes less than one minute to write. You can even make this a regular habit: once a week, or even once a day. 
At some point, maybe after 4-8 interactions of praise, they will build a sense of trust that you genuinely appreciate them and want to be in a lasting relationship with them. Once that happens, you have the leeway to point out things that you wish they would do differently (which is best done synchronously, not via text). But never forget to continue to praise as well. 
I encourage you to experiment with this at home first. Try it with a child or spouse. I predict that you will experience magic.

Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzF-otDuBWKC2GShJKcFsxCyabK1V3skQwCMU89tDmY/edit# ,"Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min)

Interpersonal conflict arises often. And almost always it is due to people:
Not fully sharing their feelings and thoughts.
Not feeling heard. 
There is a laughably simple method for solving this issue. Stephen Covey shared the technique in his iconic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change. Michael Rosenberg codified it in Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life. And Chris Voss showed its effectiveness in his excellent Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It. I recommend reading all three of these books to get fully immersed in their techniques, but here is the thousand-foot view:
When people distrust or dislike each other, usually, it is because they don't feel heard. For me to respect you, I don't need for you to agree with me. But I do need for you to listen to what I have to say. When I tell you my perspective (which I, of course, believe to be right) and you aren't immediately convinced, I assume you didn't hear or understand what I said. If you start sharing your perspective, I will be uncompelled and unwilling to truly listen because you haven't been willing to consider mine. And the cycle spirals downward to distrust and dislike.
There is a simple fix. You only need to prove to me that you have ""heard"" me. And to do that, you only need to repeat back what I've said in summary form by saying ""I think I heard you say …"" until I say, ""That's right!"" Then I will feel heard. I will now be open to hearing what you have to say. 
(Here is an experiment that proves this principle. The next time you encounter a person repeating themselves, stop them and ask if you can state back what they've already said. They will say ""yes."" You then summarize what they've said and ask if you got it right. If they say ""yes"" again, then watch to see if they continue to repeat themselves. They will not.)
To resolve conflict, you only need to get each person to state their deepest, darkest thoughts and then prove that each has heard what the other has said. This action can be done verbally or in writing. I far prefer the written method as it takes about ⅓ the time, requires almost no facilitation (i.e., it's easy to stay on the script), and the action items that come out of it are impeccable agreements.
If you are the facilitator, here's how it works (the written method):
Step 1: Ask each person to write down their deepest thoughts about the other person.
Participants, please open up a Doc. Please give me (the facilitator) access, but do not give access to the other person yet. 


On the doc, write five categories: 
Anger (present)
Fear (future)
Sadness (past)
Joy (present and past)
Excitement (future)


In every significant relationship, we have feelings of Anger, Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement. When you think about the other person and focus on the anger you feel, what thoughts come to mind? Please write those thoughts in the following way: 
Feeling: Anger
Story: The thought that I had was …. 
(By framing this as a thought or story in your head, it takes away the sting of judgment, because you are sharing that this is just a thought that you have, not the absolute truth.)
Request: Please do or say …. 
(An action that the other can take to address this situation entirely.)


Here is an example: 
Feeling: Anger 
Story: I thought that you purposely ignored me and thus were really saying ""Screw you!"" to me.
Request: From now on, when you walk by me, please say ""hello.""


As the facilitator, look at both docs and make sure that the participants fill them out correctly. Make sure that requests are explicit and that the participants can take verifiable actions.
If one or both are reluctant to say anything, which is often the case, you supply the thoughts you might have if you were in their shoes. Be dramatic. Become an actor. Get into the role. State the thoughts as explicitly as they would appear in your mind. Use swear words.
The person will start to guide you. They are likely to say: ""That's close, but not quite it. The thoughts I have are more like …"" When they slow down or don't seem willing to go further, again state the thoughts for them. Each time you do so, it allows them to go further. Do this until each person has written down their raw, unvarnished thoughts around anger toward the other. Once they get that right, they can usually get through Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement on their own.


Now ask each participant to cut and paste the Joy and Excitement sections to the top of the doc. For the person sharing their emotions and thoughts, it is hard to feel Joy and Excitement until they have first written down their thoughts around Anger and Fear. But when the recipient reads the doc, it is best to see how the sharer actually has positive thoughts about the recipient. This action validates the relationship and motivates the recipient to do what is needed to repair that relationship. Therefore, the recipient needs to read the thoughts around Joy and Excitement first.
Step 2: Person A (with less power in the relationship) shares access to their doc with Person B.
Person A says out loud her stories around Joy and Excitement to Person B. Person B should simply say ""thank you"" to Person A when she hears these thoughts.


Person B then reads through Person A’s stories around Sadness, Fear or Anger to Person B.   She picks the one the feels biggest, and asks Person A to say that one out loud.


Person B then makes Person A feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).  This is the key step!!
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 
Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  If they share more, go back to step a.
Repeat the above process until Person A says “No, that’s it.”
You, the facilitator, then follow this script:


The facilitator asks Person B: ""Do you want to make Person A feel Anger and have these thoughts?"" 
Person B: ""No."" 
If the answer is ""yes,"" then the two should not be in a relationship together. That means that one will likely need to be let go from the organization. Regardless of seniority, the person to be let go should usually be the person who wants the other to feel anger. That person will likely create toxic relationships with others and eventually will have to leave the company anyway.


Facilitator to Person A: ""What request do you have of Person B?"" 
Person A: ""Please do the following: ….""


If Person B agrees, have Person B write down the action item (with their initials and due date) just below the fact/judgment of Person A.
The goal is to co-create a plan so that misunderstanding and anger do not enter the relationship again. Person A goes first. Person B adds their thoughts. They go back and forth until they have agreed on a written plan.
Verbal agreements are not impeccable. We all understand words a little bit differently. To make this agreement impeccable, one of the participants writes down the plan, and the other adds their initials and a ""+1"" to note their agreement. 
Facilitator to Person A: ""Do you feel heard? Do you feel that Person B wants to have a positive relationship with you?""
Person A: ""Yes.""
If the answer is ""no,"" get curious and find out why. Repeat the steps above until the answer is ""yes.""
Do not move on to a second Anger item yet.
Step 3: Person B shares access to their doc with Person A.
Repeat the same script as in Step 2. 
Now both Person A and Person B have:
affirmed that they want to be in a positive relationship with each other.
accepted the feedback and created an action item to resolve it.
Step 4: When the ""ah-ha"" moment of understanding occurs, seal it with a physical connection: a handshake, a high-five, a hug.
When Step 3 is complete, there will usually be a moment of understanding and compassion for each other. When this moment occurs, seal it with a physical connection. If the two have hugged in the past, ask them to do so again now. If the most they have done in the past is shake hands or high-five, then ask them to do that now. This physical connection symbolizes the new understanding and puts a capstone on the event.
Step 5: Ask each person for feedback on the process.
What did you like that I (as facilitator) did? 


What did you wish that I had done differently?
Step 6: Set a meeting for 1-2 weeks out between Person A, Person B, and the Facilitator. 
If the first meeting was rocky, schedule a 1-1 with each participant before the second group meeting. During these 1-1s, help each person share their deepest thoughts, stay on script and view the feedback they receive as a gift.


At the second group meeting, confirm that both Person A and B have completed their action items. This step will prove to each other that there is a genuine desire for a positive relationship.


Do Steps 2-4 on the remainder of issues identified under Anger and Fear for each person.
In my experience, when two people, who previously hated each other, have shared their thoughts (and been heard) around all five of the basic emotions they feel toward the other, the two create an understanding and respect for each other even if they still do not agree with the others' positions. Please let me know if you experience something different.

Board feedback with Matt Mochary (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPsqJVz37Gs3Fy48w57pGzAdB905OtZ4ZRCvaM2B07U/edit ,"Board feedback with Mochary (4 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about receiving feedback (5 min)
In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the Board and the CEO.
As Board Members, we want to share our knowledge and network with the founder to help her succeed (and therefore make our investment more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass that founder, so we rarely give our full critical feedback, and certainly not in a board meeting group setting.
As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our advisors and board members. But we often forget to ask for full critical feedback specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.
Both the withholding from the board members and not asking for feedback from the founder cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.
The exercise:
We schedule 80-minutes together. All board members, the CEO, and Matt.
All do the following pre-reads: 
This doc (5 min) 
Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s (3 min)
If you want to know even more, you can read Feedback (15 min) 
If you are the type of person that likes to do pre-work, please do Steps 3a and 3b before the meeting. 
If you run best by acting in the moment, you can do Steps 3a and 3b live in the meeting.
During that meeting/call 
Each board member creates a private scratchpad for themselves.  I recommend a blank Google Doc.
Each board member writes down in that scratchpad what actions the CEO has done that they LIKE, and what steps they WISH THAT the CEO would do (or not do). [10 minutes] 
Please give the rawest WISH THAT feedback that you can think of. 
If you write multiple points, please place the most important one to you at the top.
The CEO will unpack only the rawest of this feedback. 
Yes, it's a competition!
During this writing time, the CEO can respond to emails.
All paste their feedback into the shared doc. 
Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. [5 minutes] 
The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship. 
Each person reads their top WISH THAT to the CEO [5 minutes]
We can’t really understand the full message until we read it AND hear it spoken as well.
All read through the remainder of the WISH THAT feedback. [5 minutes] 
Each person adds in comment +1 to WISH THAT feedback from others that they agree with. 
After the CEO completes hearing and reading WISH THAT feedback from a person, he says ""Thank you (name of person)"" to confirm that he has heard or read their feedback.
The CEO picks the juiciest WISH THAT feedback and fully unpacks it by following this script: Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A's [10 minutes] 
Ask
Acknowledge
Appreciate
Accept
Action.
The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WISH THATs until the meeting time is over or all of the juicy feedback has been processed. [50 minutes] 
If there is enough time, it is ideal to unpack each board member's top issue (so that each feels heard).
All need to recognize that board members are highly qualified to give feedback in some areas (the effectiveness and efficiency of the board meeting, their interaction with the CEO) and less qualified in other areas (how to run the company). It doesn't mean that board members shouldn't give feedback in areas they are not as qualified in; it just means the CEO will be putting that feedback through a more stringent filter to see whether it resonates with him/her.
You may be thinking, ""Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt."" Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the feedback as an attack, not a gift. This response rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And it is why Matt is there. 
If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release their anger and see the feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if he is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.
Notes:
I have done this exercise at Confluent, Reddit, Sonder, Mattermost, Viz, etc. And each of those boards and CEOs have found it to be worthwhile. If anything, they've wanted it to be longer.


The full version of this exercise takes 80 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.


If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then here is the follow-up: 
CEO asks for written feedback at the end of every board meeting.
CEO treats all feedback as the gift it is.
After the CEO has read the feedback (can be after the board meeting), she lets the board know what actions she will be taking.
At the beginning of the next board meeting, she lets the board know which of these actions she has completed and the results.
If the board members are open to it, the CEO gives written feedback to each board member in their subsequent interaction (likely 1-1).

Instructions
In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the CEO and Exec Team and between Exec Team peers. 
As members of the Exec Team, we want to share our experience and observations with the CEO and our peers to help each succeed (and therefore make our collective equity more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass those people (imagine the pain of creating an enemy out of any one of them!), so we rarely give our full critical Feedback, and certainly not in the group setting of an Exec Team meeting.
As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our incredibly knowledgeable Exec Team. But we often forget to ask for this specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.
Both the Executive Team's withholding and not asking for Feedback from the CEO cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.
The exercise:
We schedule 2 hours (actually 1 hour and 50 minutes) together. All Exec Team members, the CEO, and Matt. 
When you schedule the meeting, please email-connect Matt to all the participants to ensure that they do all the pre-work below.


All attendees do this pre-work: 
Read this doc (3 min)
Read Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s (3 min)
Optional.  If you want more detail, you can read Feedback (15 min)
Write down (in a private note that only you have access to so that your writings do not influence others): 
1-5.  
How is the CEO performing 1-5?
3 is “meeting expectations”
5 is “she couldn’t be any better”
1 is “she couldn’t be any worse”
LIKE.  
What actions the CEO has done that you like?  Please …
Give a clear example (ie- “On March 22, you did the following …”
Write only one LIKE.  The CEO just needs to see/hear that you see some value in them.  But anything more than one LIKE is overkill.
WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL.  
What actions the CEO would need to take to get to the next level of performance (1-5).  Please …
Give the rawest WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback that you can think of. The CEO will unpack only the rawest. Yes, it's a competition!
Focus your Feedback on the behaviors of the CEO, not company issues. (Company issues are a different exercise.)
Write specific actions that you want the CEO to do. Please be very specific. 
Good: 
When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now.  I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”
Not good: 
Don’t act in anger.
Write only one set of NEXT LEVEL feedback.  The CEO will not have time to read more than one set from each person.  So please pick the single most important and impactful piece of feedback.  
During our meeting/call 
Brief introduction of the purpose of the meeting. [2 minutes]
Matt creates a shared Doc. All paste their Feedback into that doc. [2 minutes]
Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. [6 minutes] 
The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship. 
All read through all of the WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback. [10 minutes] 
Each person adds in comment +1 to WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback from others that they agree with. 
CEO picks the single juiciest and most popular Feedback, and fully unpacks it. [20 minutes] 
CEO asks the author to state the feedback verbally so that the CEO can fully understand it.  
CEO thanks the author for being willing to share this information. It took bravery. 
CEO summarizes what she thinks she read and asks, ""Is that right?"" 
If the CEO wants to go to the advanced level, she will summarize what the person is really thinking (with swear words!) and feeling, as that is usually much bigger than what they are willing to write/say. Example: 
What was written: 
When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now.  I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”
What is likely in their head: 
Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!
If the author says ""No,"" the author restates, and the CEO tries to summarize again. Repeat until the author says ""Yes.""
Once the author says ""Yes,"" then the CEO asks, ""Is there more?""
Once the author says, ""No, that's it,"" the CEO asks, ""Do you feel heard?""
Once the author says ""Yes,"" then ...
CEO declares whether or not she accepts the Feedback. 
There is no requirement to accept. She only does so if the Feedback resonates with her.
If the CEO accepts the Feedback, all team members do a Brainstorming: written for 3 minutes to list what actions the CEO could take to enact the feedback.  [10 minutes]
The CEO reviews all the actions, and declares which ones she accepts. 
When declaring an action, it is critical to write down: 
What the action is
The date by which it will be done
Who will do it
If the CEO does not accept the Feedback, she shares with the author what is going on in the CEO's world to show why she does not accept the Feedback.  [5 minutes]
""Here is what is going on for me. (Then explain all that is happening.) Given that, how can I accept this Feedback?""
The CEO's description should be so thorough that it becomes clear to the author why the Feedback isn't actionable.
The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL feedback from other authors (ideally unpacking one from each author) until the meeting time is over, or the CEO processes all of the juicy Feedback. [50 minutes]
Wrap up. Appreciate one other person in the group for something they did during the meeting. [5 minutes]
Give written Feedback to Matt about the meeting itself [5 minutes]


""Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt.""
Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full Feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that Feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the Feedback as an attack, not a gift. This reaction rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And that is why Matt is there. 
If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release her anger and see the Feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if Matt is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.
Notes:
I have done this exercise at Plaid, Coinbase, Brex, Sonder, Attentive, etc. Each of those exec teams and CEOs has found it to be worthwhile.
The full version of this exercise takes 110 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50-80 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.
If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then there is a follow-up: 
CEO asks for Feedback in all 1-1s and Team Meetings going forward: 
CEO asks for written Feedback at the end of every Exec Team meeting or 1-1.
CEO treats all Feedback as the gift it is.
After the CEO has read the Feedback (can be after the team meeting), she lets the team know what actions she will take against that Feedback.
At the beginning of the next team meeting, she lets the team know which of these actions he has completed and the results.
Peers give each other Feedback in the Team Meeting. 
After several successful cycles of giving the CEO feedback, ask the Exec Team if they would be open to providing Feedback and receiving Feedback to and from each other in the group. If yes from all, add this to the next team meeting. Start with pairs. Rotate to a new pair each meeting.
Do it in writing. Either: 
Each pair creates a shared doc that they use, following the same format above. Or
Create a group shared doc, and each pair puts their Feedback in the group doc. 
This requires pre-approval by every team member to view all Feedback as a gift and not feel shame if they receive brutal Feedback in this group setting. Be skeptical. Many will say yes when they mean no.

Regina Gerbeaux’s Bias Towards Action,https://www.coachingfounder.com/post/bias-toward-action,"Over the years, I have trained myself to get things done efficiently and quickly.  As a result, people often say, “Wow, how do you get so much done in so little time?!”  The truth is, I’m not special.  Anyone can learn to do this.  The secret is having a bias towards action.

The “bias towards action” method worked for me ...

now as the COO of Mochary Method as we build the Method into software and simultaneously train world-class coaches
when I was Chief of Staff to Matt Mochary and had to help him feel like a Superhuman
when I was Head of Operations at On Deck and tasked with launching 20+ fellowships in 2021, and
when I bootstrapped my first company, a boutique music school, to $1mm in ARR
Below is the framework I use.

‍

STEP 1:  DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?
First, just because you can get something done, doesn’t mean you should.

And just because someone has asked you to do something, doesn’t mean you should do it.

Before you agree to do something, remember that for every request you say “yes” to, you’re saying “no” to something else.  Is that trade-off worth it?

Here are a few more questions you can ask yourself:

If you are a manager: how important is it for you yourself to do it?  Instead, can you delegate it to one of your direct reports?
If you are an individual contributor: is the task in harmony with what your manager’s priorities are?  Is it in the company’s best interest?*
*For a deeper understanding on what “company’s best interest” means, please read No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings.  Here is an excellent summary on the book by Matt Mochary.

TL;DR:  should you say yes to that thing?  Think carefully about the time spent and the payoff for doing it.

👉  Here’s a tip:  try to say yes to things that are only full-bodied “yes.”  That means saying yes when your head, heart, and gut are all in agreement.  (Hat tip to Kat Agostino for this amazing insight.)

‍

☝ Regina’s personal experience: I used to have a hard time saying no to people and tasks that didn’t energize me.  Then, one day, I realized that everything I said half-bodied “yes”es to zapped away time that Matt needed me working on high-output tasks. As a result, I started experimenting with valuing my time at the same cost as Matt’s hourly rate. The result:  All of a sudden, it became much easier to say no.
‍

STEP 2A:  IS THIS THE BEST THING I CAN BE DOING WITH MY TIME RIGHT NOW?
If you have decided that it is, indeed, worth it to do the task and that it’s in the company’s best interest, the next step is to ask yourself:  Is this the most important task on my plate right now?

When I decide how to structure my work day and what stuff I’ll get done, I first consult my Actions Towards Goals.

💡 Here is a framework for figuring out your actions towards goals:

Look at your company’s goals.  This can exist in the form of an MVV (Mission, Vision, Values), OKRs and KPIs, or a Product Roadmap if your company is pre-product market fit.

For further reading on Product Roadmap, please read this.
For further reading on Mission, Vision, and Values, take a look at MM’s vision doc here.
‍‍
Look at your Areas of Responsibility (AORs).  If your company doesn’t have an AOR list, I highly encourage you to help them implement one.  That way, there is no ambiguity in who owns what processes across the entire org.

To implement AORs, check this out.‍
‍
Look at your action tracker.  Look at the agreements you’ve made with others on the tasks you have promised.

For further information, I recommend checking out my Asana as an Agreements Tracker playlist to see how to implement one in your org.
If you’re a manager, your main job is likely following up on actions with your immediate team and cross-functionally with other department heads.

If you’re an IC, your main job is likely working on projects your manager and you have collectively agreed on you owning.

‍

STEP 2B:  EXAMPLE: COMPANY GOALS → PERSONAL WORK GOALS → ACTION
👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)

Below are screenshots from my own personal actions tracker.  I answer the following questions, step by step:

What are the company goals?
Based on those goals, what should my work goals be?
What are the actions I can do to finish those goals?
Regina’s example...
Here are my current company goals, pulled from our Mission, Vision, Values doc.


Here is how I’ve chosen my Actions Towards Goals (notice that each section has one action item: product, people, and self.)


And as a result, here is what I choose to do daily because it is the best use of my time:


After going through this line of questioning, it becomes abundantly clear what I have to do to move the needle forward.  Everything else is a distraction.

I reevaluate this list of priorities on a weekly basis to make sure I’m still on track.

‍

STEP 3A:  HOW CAN I MAKE THIS ACTION HAPPEN IN THE NEXT 30 MINUTES?
Post it note on a laptop that says: ""Is there an action here?"" (Prompt) ""What is the action here?""
This was the post-it that inspired Nate to ask me about bias towards action, and actually the post-it that started this entire blog post.
Recently, I was teaching Nate Forster, Matt Mochary’s newest Chief of Staff and my successor in the role, how to get sh*t done quickly.

I taught Nate that if he wanted to be massively productive, any time someone gave him a task he decided was worth doing, or he assigned himself something, I encouraged him to ask himself that question.

He then joked that Frank Slootman, the CEO of Snowflake, wrote in his book Amp It Up that the #1 question he asked his team was, “What can we do to make this happen today?”

I suppose, then, my mantra is just Frank Slootman’s mantra on steroids: “How can I make this action happen in the next 30 minutes?”

One of the biggest hurdles of having a bias towards action is expecting perfection right from the get-go.

Rather than ...

jumping down the rabbit hole of hypothetical “what-ifs” that never happen, or
waiting to ship until a product is utterly perfect,
...instead, optimizing for getting something in front of an audience and iterating from there is the best way to make progress towards goals.

☝️  A NOTE FOR MANAGERS
When I work with my team, I find that this is a helpful prompt in promoting a bias towards action culture.  It puts them in the driver’s seat, helps them lean into their autonomy, and gives them decision-making power.

In fact, the semantics here matter.

Matt and I have gotten in a habit of requesting that our teammates declare what they’re going to do and actively solicit our feedback.

Here's an example of what you can send to your direct reports to challenge them into acting with autonomy.  Notice how I write to Sabrina, “What do you intend to do?”  This has worked for every person who reports to me, regardless of their seniority level.


‍

STEP 3B:  EXAMPLE:  SHIP IT FASTER THAN AN MVP
Tweet from Joe Brown that reads ""In April we'll be launching an app on @bubble that will handle 20,000-30,000 concurrent users in its first month. and of course, @alanpodemski is just making the tastiest UI elements for this thing with a screenshot showing a task being completed.
Joe (@cuhpajo) is so excited to launch our app that he’s throwing out all sorts of teasers about it.  If you’re reading this... now you know what he’s talking about.  :)
👉  (If you like seeing real-life examples, continue reading.  Otherwise, skip to the next section.)

One great example I have on truncating timelines is Mochary Method’s work using no-code.

First, custom software takes a long time to build.

Mochary Method is creating the all-in-one solution for startups to run their companies effectively.  But we all know that takes a long time.  So, what next?

The solution:  I was curious on whether no-code could be an effective solution for prototyping our software.

So, a few months ago, we began working with Joe Brown and the team at Smaal Co to get an MVP off the ground, all built in Bubble.

We were given an estimate that our entire software would take around four months to build.  MVPs are supposed to be the quickest things to ship, right?  Right.  So that should be the fastest we can get something off the ground.

But what if that was wrong?

We had an even more radical idea:  what if we could build another tool concurrently that could be shipped in a matter of weeks?  This would prove whether we could even build a proper MVP in Bubble to begin with.

Using the same “30-minutes” thinking principle, I challenged Joe to build us a no-code tool, with design and database architecture able to integrate into the larger tool, all in a matter of two weeks.

Sure enough, Joe said yes.  And two weeks later, we had a product that worked!  This gave us the confidence that we could, indeed, prototype using Bubble.

‍


The proposal to craft a working prototype complete with design and database architecture in a matter of days.
‍


The resulting prototype, built in a matter of days and ready to test.
‍

But why stop there?  We were on a roll and loved no-code.  After completing that project, we asked: was there another piece the Smaal Team could create in the same timeline?

When we asked, Joe say he could build us another tool on our Santa’s wishlist of no-code products, but that tool would take at least month.  What followed was a conversation of how we could make it happen faster.

This first photo is of the proposal suggesting our tool be built in a four-week timeline, with some added time for QA testing before launch.

‍


Initial proposal: 4 week timeline.
‍

The next photo was my back-and-forth conversation with Joe on what action items he could take to make the development go faster, which resulted in an accelerated timeline.

‍


‍

In the end, we ended up agreeing to ship the Energy Audit tool in a little over two weeks.  This was faster than the original suggested timeline of a month (or more!), just because I asked:  “How can we make this happen faster?”

‍

STEP 4:  WHAT CAN I ACCOMPLISH BEFORE SOMEONE ASSIGNS ME AN ACTION?
The final step (Frank Slootman’s mantra on double-steroids) is:

What action items can I give myself and do to make this goal happen before anyone assigns me an action item?
An operator’s greatest superpower is being able to predict the needs of the organization before anyone asks them to do it.

This means preemptively going through the logic tree in Step 2a and giving yourself action items to act on before anyone else does it for you.

This is shockingly simple to implement.  All you have to do is ask yourself what actions you need to take to reach the goals.

In order to better illustrate how to do this, I’ve left a few examples from various chapters of my own life on how Bias Towards Action might look as an IC, a manager, and a founder.

‍

REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR
When I was Matt’s Chief of Staff, because Matt’s goals were effectively my goals, I would ask myself: “What is the next action item I can take to advance his goals before he even needs to think about asking me?”

This could apply to literally anything.  Asking this question helped me:

draft emails for Matt to follow up with VIPs in his inbox (corresponding goal:  get Matt to Inbox Zero and connect with interesting people)
line up plane tickets and hotel options for his next trip (corresponding goal:  Restore)
suggest meeting times for the next retrospective to debrief with the Engineering team (goal:  ship V1 of software by the end of the year)
The common theme was that Matt’s life was now plug-and-play:  he didn’t have to think because I did all the thinking for him.  This left him time and brain space to think about stuff that he loved thinking about: coaching and being the visionary of the software.

‍

REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS A MANAGER
In my previous job, I saw that the company I worked for had ambitious goals of launching 20+ fellowships (our “product”) by 2Q21.  Here was my thought pattern which made it happen before anyone asked me to think about it:

The company’s goal is to launch 20+ products by 2Q21.  Therefore, it is the Operations Department’s goal to put infrastructure and resourcing in place to handle 20+ products.
What are the building blocks to make create one product happen?Answer: playbook everything and document along the way.  Everyone needs to contribute to documentation efforts.‍
What is the minimum amount of resourcing we need to make one product?Answer:  we need at least one director and one operations associate to launch, and one EA per 3-5 product launches.‍
With that number, what do we need to make twenty products?Answer:  at least 20 operations associates, and at least 4 EAs to assist with said product launches provided we stagger product launches.‍
When do we need to start hiring by to hit our deadline of resourcing, training, and deploying operations associates?Answer:  yesterday.  Next-best day is today.‍
Which departments do we have to collaborate with in the company to make this work?Answer:  all of them.  Write out exactly what we need from every department and don’t stop until we get what we need from each of them.
The result of this bias-towards-action thinking was:

We were able to launch all 20 products by our given timeline
We were able to hire, train, and deploy 15 operations associates in one quarter
We had playbooks in the Operations department written in the event that I needed to pass the role onto someone else
The company was able to successfully raise $20mm in Series A funding, in part because of the hockey stick growth in revenue from the product launches

An example of one of the pieces of documentation created in order to accommodate scale.
REGINA’S EXAMPLE AS A FOUNDER
Lastly, I’ll share an example from my Founder days.  Before I was familiar with the term, we hit product-market fit.

We had a waiting list of clients that was 1.5 years long, there were over 100 people in and out of my apartment-turned-music-studio every week, and I had clients that were throwing fistfuls of money in my face for the chance of getting music lessons using my methodology.

Below was my line of questioning to go from a solo bootstrapper into a full-fledged music school.‍

‍What was the goal? Answer: create the best, world-class piano school in all of Los Angeles county.‍
What has to be true for that goal to happen? Answer: I need to hire and train teachers to teach using my methodology.  I need training seminars and a way to make my methodology repeatable (therefore, documenting everything.)  Lastly, I need an actual music space: my tiny apartment isn’t cutting it anymore.‍
What has to happen to make that scenario true? Answer: Find, hire, and train two teachers to absorb my methodology.  Document and record everything along the way.  Find a commercial space by mid-1Q17.‍
What is going to take the most time? Answer: Finding the commercial space with the needed specs:  at least 1000 sqft for all the grand pianos, within budget, easy to access for parents, and soundproofing installed.‍
What are the next actions? Answer: After finding the space...

Negotiate for landlord-paid improvements to get walls, flooring, etc. covered to keep us in budget.  Offer to cover soundproofing since it’s a music business-specific expense.
Get building permits + get architect’s blueprints approved.
Cause building company to build the whole damn thing in 14 days.
Have a furniture-building party with friends to pitch in to open the school in time.
The results:  we opened our doors in February 2017, scaled to well over $500k in bootstrapped revenue during the first year, and ended up hiring a lean team of five people.  Because I started from the goal and planned for what we needed, we were instantly profitable from the get-go.  To this day, the school continues to live on.

CONCLUSION
Bias towards action can be cultivated and trained over time.  When you master this skill, you will apply it to all facets of your life with massive success.  At that point, congratulations — I think you’ve truly become an excellent operator.

Leadership is many things: the capacity to get things done with and through your team, an art, a constant unfolding of learning, responding and adapting, especially as your business evolves and matures over time. 

That said, every leader has their blind spots and growth edges — within their organizations, and in their lives — and yet it can be challenging to put your finger on those precise needs. 

Here’s how to find where you can improve:

Emergent Competencies
Yes, there are principles that we can all agree upon (see below) as core leadership competencies, but as a coach, I believe it’s far more impactful to focus first on what your team and your company need from you. 

In your 1:1s, ask your direct reports (and anyone else you’d like to involve in this information gathering process — e.g. mentors, board members, other team members) the following questions:

What do they need from you?
What do they want more of from you?
What’s not helpful for them?
What do they appreciate the most about how you lead?

Set 30 minutes of uninterrupted time aside for yourself when your mind is fresh and sit with the following questions:

What are you most proud of in how you lead?
What would you like to do more of to be even more effective as a leader?
Where do you feel like you’re hitting a limit/plateau?
Where do you wish you could do better/be a more effective leader?
Where and when are you getting stuck?
Tune into when you feel dissatisfaction, frustration, anger and confusion throughout your work days. These emotions can be extremely helpful in shining a light on growth edges and upper limits.

For each of the items you come up with, clearly spell out why it’s important to you. Without that “why” you can lose focus and momentum, especially when the work to improve is uncomfortable.

Skim Over Our Curriculum


What areas jump out at you as growth edges? 
Consider sharing the curriculum with your executive team. What areas jump out at them as growth edges?

Core Leadership Competencies
Anywhere you look, you can find list after list of different frameworks and critical competencies leaders “must” have. I prefer guidance from orgs like McKinsey that provide insights based on emergent data. Consider these “4 of 20 behaviors [that] explain 89 percent of the variance between strong and weak leaders” per McKinsey & Co.:


Supporting Others
As CEO, the best thing you can do to support your team is to drive clarity (e.g. be crystal clear on the “what” so they can deliver the “how”) and unblock your team. When you do this, and your team feels your genuine care for them, you “build trust and inspire and help colleagues to overcome challenges.”
Solving Problems Effectively
This is nuanced and tricky to nail, but leaders and leadership teams make good decisions when this is done well. A big blocker here for most leaders is how to support through accountability.
Operating with a Strong Results Orientation
“Leaders with this trait emphasize the importance of efficiency and productivity and prioritize the highest-value work.” This is directly connected to the mission critical importance of setting goals/KPIs/OKRs for your team so that they know what to prioritize.
Seeking Different Perspectives
We know how dangerous echo chambers and biases can be. Leaders who embody this trait “typically base their decisions on sound analysis and avoid the many biases to which decisions are prone.”

Here’s the larger list of 20 behaviors from McKinsey’s article Decoding Leadership: What Really Matters.


Next Steps
With this clarity in mind, remember that consistency is key to meaningful behavioral change. You’ve had your whole life to get great at whatever behavior you want to change, so give yourself grace and time to stick the landing on how you’re trying to change.

Also remember to not try to “boil the ocean” by tackling everything all at once. Discern what is truly most urgent and mission critical for you and your org, and prioritize those top items. Talk it through with your coach, and they’ll help you be as efficient and effective as possible when tackling each growth edge while shortening the learning curve.

"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LLfA6TgDoynzduB-2Xp0XHmMN5lUiRxx8ht3VjYJ0E/edit ,"Remote happiness, how to create it (9 min)

With the advent of forced remote, many CEOs find that some of their team members are profoundly unhappy. They see this when valued team members choose to leave the 500+ person company and move to another job, most often to an organization with just a few people (early startup or investment firm), or to no job at all. This move often appears illogical. The person is giving up lots of compensation. The CEO often feels personally insulted and undoubtedly confused. 
There is no need to be confused. The reasons are actually logical. 
In this remote world, many people feel disconnected, which leads to sadness, often intense sadness (i.e., depression). Those in this state know that something needs to change, but they are not sure what. Their job is the activity that consumes most of their day, so they often assume the cause lies. They believe that their disconnection comes from the fact that they are working at a ""big company."" If they leave for a small company, they will regain a sense of connection. 
Unfortunately, they rarely do because their disconnection is not coming from the company's size but rather how they are working remotely. 
Most managers feel that they are not allowed to ask about a report's personal life, and therefore are unwilling to ask about the report's home environment and daily routines. This tactic is a mistake. The manager is a coach whose role is to help their report unpack and solve the issues that the report faces, whether they appear in their work or personal world. 
Therefore, as a manager, if you sense that one of your reports is unhappy or experiencing mental/emotional pain, ask them about it. Ask them about their home environment and daily routine. I posit that you will likely discover that they do not do or have at least one of the following:
Get outside
See other people that they know
Exercise
Have access to a consistently uninterrupted space to take Zoom calls
I posit that humans need four things to feel mentally balanced:
Connection to nature
Connection to tribe
Blood flow
Uninterrupted workspace
Pre-COVID, we could each achieve these to some degree simply by going to an office. 
We had to leave our residence each day to get to transportation which brought us to and from the office. By leaving our home, we encountered outside air, even if only briefly, which created a connection to nature.
We saw other people in the office who were familiar to us. They may not have been our best friends, but we knew them. We said hello and goodbye, maybe had lunch with them, perhaps even met for drinks after work, and shared an occasional laugh. This action created a connection to a tribe.
We had to physically walk to transport, which got our bodies moving a little bit and thus our blood flowing a bit. Many of us took advantage of being out by going to the gym and really getting our blood to flow.
The design of the modern office is for performance, with call booths, conference rooms, or private offices for meetings and calls. Thus, we had uninterrupted workspaces.
We achieved these things unwittingly. 
Rather than convince you that these elements create a feeling of peace and satisfaction, I challenge you to experiment with them. 
Naturally, going to an in-person office gave us each of these to a small degree. Suppose we are intentional about creating them in a work-from-home environment. In that case, we can achieve them to a much higher degree, and therefore feel even greater personal satisfaction than we did when going to the office. 
Here is how I do it:
Connection to nature. 
I take a 5-minute walk outside at the beginning of the day before I start work. And I take a 5-minute walk at the end of the day once I have stopped work. 
My walk not only creates a connection to nature by getting me into the outside air, but it also is a nice signal of the transition to and from work. Before the morning and after the evening transition, I do not allow myself to work, leaving me space to focus on family and personal activities. 
I also take breaks regularly throughout the day. I only schedule 25- and 50-minute meetings, and I end all of them on time. This schedule allows me a break to go to do one or more of the following: 
go to the bathroom
get a drink of water
get a snack
get outside
prepare for the next meeting 


When I get outside (which I do at least once every 2 hours), I 
Close my eyes and face the sun (even if it's cloudy) for 1 minute. This moment creates an intense and quick connection to nature.
While doing so, I stretch my hip flexors while taking five deep breaths. This stretch gets my blood flowing.
Then I find my wife or one of my children and give them a 1-minute hug. (Truth be told, only my wife puts up with this. My kids top out at 10 seconds when they are willing to hug me at all.) Hugs create an intense and quick connection to my tribe.
Connection to tribe: 
In addition to the 1-minute hugs mentioned above, I schedule in-person socially-distant gatherings at least once a week. 
I put zero effort into hosting. I am only willing to send an email stating the time and location of the gathering. 
Sometimes it is at an open-air restaurant/bar for a drink or meal. Sometimes it is on my patio where each guest must bring whatever they want to drink or eat. 
My intent is not to be rude but rather to make organizing and hosting incredibly easy for me, increasing the likelihood that I will continue to do so. 
The purpose of these gatherings for me is laughter. I invite those with whom I can generate that laughter. 
Blood flow 
In addition to the short walks at the beginning and end of the day and the 1-minute breaks, I run on the treadmill. But rather than see how much I can do, I have experimented with how little I can do and still get the benefit of a feeling of peace and calm in my body that lasts for more than 24 hours. For me, that time is 3 minutes at 4.0 speed. I run for 5 minutes to be safe. 
Once again, my goal is to make this step so easy (i.e., short and slow) that there is no reason for me not to do it each day. 
I should note that I often skip the morning walk in favor of the 5 minutes on the treadmill because my treadmill is in an unattached garage, so I have to go outside to get to it. Thus, I am getting my connection to nature anyway. 
Uninterrupted workspace 
I have converted a back room into a Zoom studio. It is far from the locus of kids' activities, and I can lock the door so that no one accidentally wanders in. 
Many of your team members do not have a large enough home, or an unused room, to create such an uninterrupted space. The answer for them is either of the following. 
A co-working space outside the home 
Rent a home in a less expensive part of the country to afford a larger space. 
I recommend that the company provide a rent stipend for either a co-work space or a remote residence.
My wife and I have hired a homeschool teacher to be with our children. 
Many of your team members cannot afford to do this on their own. For them, you can: 
Change the culture in the company. Re-frame a child walking into a Zoom call as a welcome introduction of the team member's family to their co-workers. Ask the meeting owner to look forward to these moments to increase team bonding by getting to know each other as humans. 
Do what Gitlab does and create Juicebox Zoom calls that bring families together for remote playdates throughout the day and introduce them to children in many locations that they would otherwise never have access.
Encourage parents to partner with other families to create a micro-school (hire a teacher jointly).
With these steps above, I feel connected, grounded, and peaceful throughout the day. Even when I have back-to-back-to-back Zoom calls throughout the day, I feel energized as long as I actually take a break between each call and get outside during those breaks.
Other things contribute to my sense of well-being. They are:
Desk set-up:
I have a standing desk. Because of it, my neck, back, and body do not get sore or stiff. (Before I had a standing desk, I used a neck pillow with pressure knobs for a few minutes during breaks and at the end of the day to relieve the tension in my neck and back.)
I have placed my desk directly in front of a window. This location achieves two purposes: 
It allows me to look outside at nature throughout the day. I also open the window to allow in fresh air when the weather cooperates. This step gives me a connection to nature.
The natural light on my face is akin to professional video lighting, allowing me to appear fully present during video calls. 
Morning routine:
I follow Tim Ferriss's morning routine suggestion. 
Meditate for 10 minutes (while still in bed) using the Waking Up app.
Journal (while still in bed) using the 5-Minute Journal. 
Make my bed. 
Drink a large glass of water. 
3-minute run on the treadmill.
Every other day, I do push-ups using the Just 6 Weeks app.


This 20 minute routine invigorates me and launches me with energy and clarity into the day's tasks.
Meals:
I try to eat every meal and snack sitting outside with no phone.
Entertainment:
I try (with decent success) not to look at an electronic device for entertainment. This change means that I no longer look at my phone to view news, Twitter, YouTube, etc.


Without electronic entertainment, I force myself to do other activities during non-work times. I end up: 
Sitting outside and staring at the leaves blowing in the wind (intense connection to nature)
Talking with my wife (connection to tribe)
Talking and playing with my kids (connection to tribe)
Reading a paper book (soothing)


These activities bring me a sense of peace, whereas looking at my phone or a screen never does.
Time away:
I do not work at all on the weekends, guaranteeing myself two days of rejuvenation each week. And I take a long weekend with my family once every few months. 


Plaid recently looked at vacation days and found that their team members weren't taking them … at all. So, Plaid scheduled two 4-day weekends for 2H20. During these long weekends, no one at Plaid is allowed to work. (Of course, Plaid can't stop the sales team from responding to emails. But hopefully, they will be doing so from a lovely location.)


I recommend that you do the same.
Please think of these suggestions as experiments. There are many other ways to connect to nature, connection to tribe, blood flow, and uninterrupted workspace. 
Find the ways that work for you. Make sure that you do them every day and several times each day. 
And as a Manager, make sure that your reports are doing so as well. If you do, I posit that you and your team members will retain a lasting sense of connection, peace, and well-being. And your team members will therefore stay with the company.

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder:
""While it is often worth digging into someone's personal life, be aware that there is a risk, and this is not a universal positive. Some people will feel offended if you pressure them to reveal personal details. Instead, invite the conversation if people accept, great. If not, that's fine too.
I'm not sure that I buy that people get connected to nature by taking an Uber. But I agree that it is critical to avoid the claustrophobia of staying indoors for days. 
The recommendations above are very specific. They are one way to be happy. There are many other ways. 
One minute is a long time for a hug!
We need to update this process for a post-COVID world.”

How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bF88nIzZGJT9NTDXK6IR1ZzRCBqYMr8NK_No8nM0aI/edit ,"How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min)

As CEO, it is critical to have a personal connection with your team. They need to know that you care about them before they care about the work they do for you. 
When in the office, this personal connection is relatively easy to maintain. You say hello to them each morning and goodbye to them each evening when you leave. You see them at lunchtime and ask them about their lives. 
But how do you maintain that connection when there are no informal in-person interactions that serve as prompts to say these ""hellos,"" ""goodbyes,"" and ""what is going on in your life""? 
Create your own prompts.
First, get to know some personal information about each person on your team (the name of their spouse, their children, their pets, where they grew up, what they like to do for fun).  You can create a Personal Info, Team - example (1 min) and ask people to enter their information there.
Then, schedule some time each week (I recommend one hour per week) to reach out to various members of your community (work team, investors, family, friends) and let them know that you are thinking of them. The message need not be long. The only intent is to let them know that you are thinking about them.
Here are some examples:
""Thinking of you. Hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke are doing well.""
""I saw this article on tennis and thought of you.""
That's it. The message need not be long nor elaborate. The only purpose is to let your colleague know that you are thinking about them and remember the important things about their life. 
It takes very little time, and it is massively effective. 
You are likely thinking: ""Matt, this is such an obvious ploy. My people will see right through it.""
If so, to you, I reply: ""Many of my coachees still send me messages like this. I know exactly what they are doing. Hell, I'm the one who showed them how to do it. And yet, I appreciate it every time. Because I know that they intend to create a connection with me and that always feels good.""
Another anecdote: The best operating CEO I've ever known, who self-admittedly doesn't have much emotional intelligence at all, once asked me: ""Matt, please help me to be more empathetic and create an emotional connection with my team."" So, I gave him the advice above. Being the best operator, he immediately and faithfully followed the advice. 
A month later, I facilitated a 2-day offsite for him and his executive team. When, at one point, he left the room, the entire executive team turned to me, and said ""How did you do it? He used to be a robot. And then about 30 days ago, he suddenly turned into this super-caring, super-compassionate guy."" And they started sharing with me examples of ways that he reached out to them in a very personal way. ""I was on the airplane with my family getting ready to go to my parents' house for Thanksgiving when I got a text from him saying: 'I hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke have a great time with your parents in Michigan. Safe travels.' I was blown away.""
Listening to all this was the newest executive hire, who had only just come on board. She was shocked. ""You mean he wasn't like this two months ago? I just went through the recruiting process with him and concluded that he is the most empathetic CEO I have ever known or even heard of.""

Do Remote Right (work in progress),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BY8fjKuF-NSQdMcw9SDwnYM1ZJLSW1bW7SNSzOHd-wU/edit ,"Do Remote Right (work in progress)

About the authors
Sid Sijbrandij is the founder and CEO of Gitlab, the largest ""intentionally remote"" company in the world by team members: over 1500 as of October 2021. Sid has spent many years perfecting the art of running an all-remote company and would like to share his learnings with the world.
Matt Mochary is the coach to many of the tech world's top CEOs (eBay, Reddit, Coinbase, Brex) and investors (Sequoia, Benchmark), including several intentionally remote companies (Gitlab, Mattermost). He has directly seen the benefits of all remote and believes that ""remote done right"" beats a hybrid, and likely an all-in-person, structure every time. 
This book, therefore, is about how to do remote right, at least in the minds of Sid and Matt.
Here is how Sid defines the stages of remote.
Introduction
In March 2020, the emerging pandemic forced the entire world to go all remote with no warning or time to prepare. Despite the utter lack of planning, most companies discovered that productivity didn't suffer. In many cases, it increased. 
But there were cracks. Parents of young children felt the stress of not having a quiet space to take work video calls. Those who lived alone felt the mental pain of being isolated for weeks and months on end. Teams started to lose emotional connection, and group meetings sometimes became cantankerous and dysfunctional because of it. Zoom fatigue became a real thing. Some people were having less fun.
Many people began to long for a return to the office, believing it would eliminate these new stresses. You may be one of these people. 
While you, or any of your team members, may long to get back to the office, an all-in-person structure is likely no longer a viable option for you— many of your team members like being remote and want to stay that way. If you want to keep them, you'll have to accommodate this desire. If you don't, they will leave for a remote company. And if you allow for both remote and office, then you'll have a hybrid structure. 
And this is where the danger begins. Here is why hybrid doesn't work. Sid and Matt believe that there will be a trough of sorrow that companies will go through when they try to implement hybrid remote. Here is why:
Twitter, Square, Facebook, and Shopify allow employees to work remotely, but that doesn't mean that those companies are closing their HQ or offices. 
""Many companies are learning that their workers are just as, or even more productive, working from home,"" all-remote is more effective even though it is happening suddenly, without proper organization, and during a pandemic that itself is stressful and lowering productivity, especially for people that have children that can't go to school.""
Somehow the lesson that companies deduce from this isn't that they should go all remote, but that they should go hybrid, combining remote and co-located work. I think that hybrid is much more challenging and less likely to be successful. This thread will include examples of why it is hard.
These companies are going hybrid for the wrong reasons. According to Mark Zuckerberg, ""Social bond building, culture, creativity, white-boarding, and brainstorming"" needs to happen at the office.


Communication and Connection. When remote, it is vital to be intentional about informal communication (see the link). But that doesn't mean that having part of the people in the office will help make the remote people feel included; instead, it will make it harder to include them. 
Tactics for creating and maintaining human connection remotely 
Speedy meetings of 25 minutes instead of 30 give you time to recover between calls and allow people to join before meetings start for some banter.
Lead with empathy: each work-related call should begin with an earnest, genuine ""How are you?"" or a similar and appropriate introduction. It's important to remember that everyone is facing a battle that you know nothing about, and in a remote setting, you should actively listen.
Welcome interruptions in calls: when pets, children, or partners interrupt a call, this is an opportunity to bond. Take a few minutes to talk to the person if they are open to it or ask the team member about their pet.
Using emojis to convey emotion: The results show that proper use of emoticons, emoji, and stickers, especially positive emotions, is conducive to relationship formation and cognitive understanding. They help participants express emotions and manage interrelations.
Talent shows: they are relatively easy to organize. Simply add a calendar invite two weeks in advance, affix a Google Doc agenda to the invite for team members to sign up to showcase a talent, arrange a panel of 3-5 judges, and have a list of prizes ready to go.
Coffee chats: have a name for 25-minute calls between two people without an agenda. This time empowers people to have these important conversations. There is no agenda, and you can talk about work or not. Make doing them part of onboarding and use@donut to have them happen regularly.
Mixer calls aim to help team members meet more folks from other groups or functions they might not otherwise get to spend a lot of time working or interacting with. Two team members set up a single Zoom line, and each of those team members invites someone else to join.
Juice Box Chats are a chance for GitLab team members and their children, grandchildren, or other members of their family to get to know one another as well. These chats can be informal or focus on a specific topic; Legos, SuperHeroes, camping, and video games are all great.
Team Social Calls are informal social calls regularly scheduled to build camaraderie. The data team has them every Tuesday. Team members and managers are encouraged to create these calls as a medium for informal, agenda-free interaction between team members.
AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions serve as an opportunity to ask funny and far-fetched questions that enable a more personal connection. It's particularly important to consider ongoing AMAs with executives. AMAs humanize leaders and remind teams that we are all more alike than unlike.
Celebrations are essential—for example, the kickoff of a new (fiscal) year or a significant revenue milestone. We've had calls with over 400 team members. Get a great MC to pump up the enthusiasm as@emilieschario does for us.
Holiday parties will be virtual during the pandemic. Think about ways to dress up for the occasion—for example, an ugly sweater competition.
Global pizza parties are where teams arrange shared meals around the world. Global pizza parties, for example, are possible to document and enjoy in a shared setting (Zoom or Slack), though one may wish to consider a breakfast pizza depending on the time zone.
Coworking calls are scheduled working sessions on Zoom where team members can work through challenging tasks with a coworker or simply hang out while each person works on their tasks. Want to try advanced mode? Screen share as you work together.
Collaboration. And stop saying that all creative thinking needs a whiteboard. There are two advantages to a whiteboard (you can draw arrows and circles) but linked are 17 reasons why a shared Google Doc is better, including that everyone can write on it simultaneously.
Who is allowed to be remote? 
At Facebook, employees will have to be at a certain seniority level to work remotely. In our experience, junior people tend to have more experience working digitally, not less.
The same experience in a meeting? Or…Horrible Hybrid Calls! 
With hybrid, it is hard to give everyone the same work experience. Shopify did a great job thinking through this and will require everyone in a meeting to be physically separate and have their camera and audio setup.
If you don't require this, you get hybrid calls, which are horrible (see link). The only thing worse isn't getting invited to the meeting in the first place because the co-located people had an impromptu chat and even forgot to tell you the outcome.
I think that whenever there is a headquarter, there will always be two ways of communicating. To get everyone on the same level, you need the leadership to leave the shared office so that the only headquarter is the one online.
Remote does not have to mean Work From Home. 
During COVID, we tend to equate working remotely with Working From Home (WFH). At GitLab, we'll pay for office space if you want it. WFH will never be the best for everyone. We see some people who prefer an office in the beginning transition to WFH during their first months.
Productive remote people will leave Hybrid for All Remote. 
My prediction is that the leadership will keep working from the headquarters at most hybrid companies, and the default way of working will degrade from 'remote first' to 'remote allowed' (remote employees a second class citizens).
Employees will discover that the company didn't shift from rewarding attendance to rewarding output and that remote workers are not getting promoted at an equal rate because they are less visible. 
The productive remote employees will leave for 'all remote' companies that invested in getting everyone a manager who understands what they do by having only one function reporting to a manager, not a multifunctional team of which the manager doesn't understand most disciplines.
After their most productive remote people leave, the hybrid companies will blame the lack of productivity on remote instead of the actual cause of hybrid being very hard. You'll see the Yahoo/IBM-like moves to force everyone to come to the office again.
Andreas Klinger, who is head of remote at AngelList, summarized this as: ""Returns optionally"" -> leadership goes back -> trips from remote-first to poorly run hybrid -> stop outside of special areas.
Some will go all remote. 
Some companies will go all remote, part of them are already canceling their leases during the pandemic, and another part will do so after finding out that hybrid is complex. Most of these will be successful, which is terrific for the world.
There is so much talent outside of the major metro areas, and all of these people can suddenly compete for the high-paying and rewarding jobs at the world's leading companies. 
Compensation 
Companies will pay market rates based on your location (see link). Rates outside of major metro areas will increase. 
Reporting. No matrix. 
At GitLab, much of the work is multi-disciplinary, but we don't have the different disciplines report to the same manager. Instead, we have stable counterparts, and we require each hire to be a 'manager of one' who can self-organize without a project manager. Here is how we do it.
Whether you believe this or not, you are remote right now and will be for several more months, if not years. You might as well try to get good at it. We challenge you to become an expert at it. If you do, and you conclude that all remote is better, you can declare that you are all remote forever. And if you do that, you instantly get the prizes of all remote. What are they?
You get to start recruiting for open positions from anywhere in the world. It is hard to describe just how beneficial this is until you experience it. On May 20, 2020, Brian Armstrong declared that Coinbase would be remote-first post-COVID. This move instantly allowed the company to start recruiting from anywhere in the world. And within 30 days, Brian declared to me (Matt) that they resolved all of Coinbase's recruiting challenges. Going remote was the single answer!
But let's get back to the problems of remote. If you can solve these, then you get to receive the All Remote prizes.
The primary problems seem to be:
Social bonding
Mental Health
Collaboration
Social bonding
If my team members trust and like each other, then when issues and friction arise, each person's first assumption is that the other is well-meaning, ""we are on the same team,"" and we can find a mutually beneficial solution. We all know that trust and like amongst team members creates a more functional work environment. If, by contrast, trust and like do not exist, then minor friction quickly escalates into anger and dysfunction. 
In the in-person world, we foster trust and like through social bonding. We say hello and goodbye, have occasional informal conversations to connect as human beings. We talk about interests outside of work (in the hallway, over drinks or food, or at an offsite event) and generally see each other doing work (and feel the comfort that work was getting done).
But in a remote world, we don't say hello and goodbye to each other each day, informal communications don't occur unless we intentionally create them, and we don't see each other doing work. 
What is the solution?
In a remote world, we must intentionally create the interactions that naturally happen in an in-person world. And if we do so, we can make them more effective than the organic ones that naturally arose before. 
Here are the things that Gitlab does to formalize informal communications. 
Taking a step back from the tactics, let's ask, ""What creates human connection?""
Matt believes that it's when ...
You know what is important to me. 
You take the time to get to know me as a human. 
At first superficially: My name and some of the important things to me outside of work (my spouse, kids, pets, hobbies, where I grew up, went to school, etc.)
And then more deeply: A dream that I have, a trauma that I have experienced, what makes me feel anger or fear, what I feel shame about, etc.
You recognize and call out the emotions or thoughts that I am experiencing. 
If I feel pain, anger, fear, or sadness, you reach out to me to confirm my feelings and thoughts. Once you have confirmed it, you help me clarify my thoughts when communicating with others. 


That you know what is essential to the organization 
You take the time to understand the priorities of the organization. 
You read the Wiki.
You know what the company Vision and quarterly company OKRs are. You can recite them.
You know the Product Roadmap and the Customer Profile/Problem, no matter what part of your organization.


That you intend to take care of issues that are important to our organization and me. 
Now that you know what is essential to the company and me, I believe that you intend to act in service of those things. You show this to me by specifically describing how what you are doing supports mine and the company's priorities. 
I gain further comfort in your intention by seeing you in multiple situations, and your behavior remains consistent. The magic number is usually five. Once I see you in five different settings or physical locations, I usually tell myself that I know your character. The amount of time I see you in these settings or locations almost doesn't matter. Five minutes is nearly as valuable as five hours. 


That you are competent. 
To achieve this care, you understand what the most important thing to do is (insightful), can take the time and space to do it (organized), and you do it well (skilled). 
We have already covered insight above. 
For organization, I either see you getting things done or using a system that I know to be effective (i.e., Getting Things Done by David Allen, Monday.com, Asana, etc.). 
For skill, I simply judge your work. But if you know my interest, show that you addressed it and organized it… that is 90% of the performance I am looking for. 
For most people, it's important to laugh and have fun. If you create this for me, you are taking care of me. But you don't need to be a comedian. If you organize an event where I have fun, I give you as much credit as the comic who made me laugh. 
Most people love to talk about themselves, as well as the people and topics they hold dear. You need not have any prior knowledge of these topics. You need only ask, be willing to listen to the answers, and appear to be interested. 
So, to create a human connection, create moments where people can;
Get to know each other as humans, both the superficial details of their life and the more serious ones.

1. Buy the equipment you need:
Video Essentials:
· Camera + lens (includes the lens in this package)
· Capture Board (it reduces latency by processing the HDMI output of the Camera through dedicated hardware)
· Power supply (allows you to plug the Camera in a power outlet and avoid relying on its battery)
· HDMI cable (connects the Camera to the capture board)
· Memory Card (you may buy two of these since the Camera has two slots)
Audio Essentials:
· Microphone (one of the best vocal microphones you can buy)
· Mic Arm (desk mounted with built-in XLR cable that connects to your mic)
· preamp (used to power your mic and connects it to your computer)
Extra items you may also want to buy:
· Mic Activator (significantly improves mic quality, connects preamp to the microphone and requires this cable)
· Camera cage (helps you install addons such as light and clamp/tripod)
· Camera Light
· Clamp (can hold the camera to a monitor or edge of a table)
· Small tripod (alternative to the clamp)
2. Set up the Camera to (a) output a clean HDMI signal and (b) bypass the memory card (that way, you can keep streaming without being capped to the memory card capacity):









3. Open the Zoom app on your computer and click on the Settings button (the little gear button; see below):







4. Click on ""Video"" and select your camera feed in the drop-down menu (see below):

Remote:  Gitlab’s Guide to All-Remote (a while),https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/ ,"GitLab's Guide to All-Remote
How to work remotely - the GitLab guide
GitLab is one of the world’s largest all-remote companies with over 1,500 team members located in more than 65 countries around the world.

Our all-remote workforce implementation is featured in The Journal of Organizational Design. It is also the centerpiece of case studies authored by Harvard Business School and INSEAD.

On this page and subpages, we’ll share what “all-remote” really means, how it works at GitLab, some tips and tricks for remote teams, and resources to learn more.

The Remote Manifesto
All-remote work promotes:

Hiring and working from all over the world (instead of from a central location).
Flexible working hours (over set working hours).
Writing down and recording knowledge (over verbal explanations).
Written processes (over on-the-job training).
Public sharing of information (over need-to-know access).
Opening up documents for editing by anyone (over top-down control of documents).
Asynchronous communication (over synchronous communication).
The results of work (over the hours put in).
Formal communication channels (over informal communication channels).
Why remote?

“Remote is not a challenge to overcome. It’s a clear business advantage.” -Victor, Product Manager, GitLab

From the cost savings on office space to more flexibility in employees’ daily lives, all-remote work offers a number of advantages to organizations and their people.

But we also recognize that being part of an all-remote company isn’t for everyone. Here’s a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages.

Our long-term vision for remote work
Learn more about GitLab’s long-term vision for remote work, and why we can embrace the future of work right now.

Why GitLab uses the term all-remote to describe its 100% remote workforce
All-remote means that each individual in an organization is empowered to work and live where they are most fulfilled. By including the word “all” in “all-remote,” it makes clear that every team member is equal. No one, not even the executive team, meets in-person on a daily basis.

Learn more about why GitLab uses the term all-remote to describe its 100% remote workforce.

Remote work starter guide: how to adjust to work-from-home
For employees who are grappling with a new remote reality (or forced work-from-home), here are five tips to implement straight away in your journey to acclimate.

The phases of remote adaptation
As teams grapple with transitioning from a colocated environment to a remote one, it’s common to see differing levels of adaptability.

Learn more about the phases of remote adaptation.

GitLab pioneers the ‘Head of Remote’ role
By hiring a Head of Remote in 2019, GitLab triggered a global movement of appointing a dedicated leader to evolve a company’s remote fluency.

This page details the backstory of the movement’s origins, explains what a Head of Remote is, provides job description templates, and open source certifications to enhance your markability as a remote work leader.

Being a great remote manager
Many traits found in superb remote managers are also found in managers of colocated teams, though there are nuances to serving, leading, and guiding when managing teams that you do not see in-person each day.

Learn what it takes to be a great remote manager.

People
All-remote organizations tend to attract people who place a high degree of value on autonomy, flexibility, empathy, and mobility. It also presents outsized opportunity for people who must live or prefer to live in rural areas, where well-paying careers in technical industries are few and far between.

Learn more about the types of people who are adopting a remote lifestyle.

Non-linear workday
How diverse, invigorating, gratifying, and productive could your day be if you threw away the notion that you had to stick to a daily routine?

Learn more about what life can look and feel like when embracing a non-linear workday.

Values
While all-remote isn’t a value itself, it’s something we do in order to practice our values.

Learn how a collection of values at GitLab contributes to a thriving all-remote environment.

Building and reinforcing a sustainable culture
Culture is best defined not by how a company or team acts when all is well; rather, by the behaviors shown during times of crisis or duress.

Learn more about creating a thriving, lasting remote culture.

Combating burnout, isolation, and anxiety
Mental health is an important topic for all companies, and creating a healthy remote workplace is essential to business success.

Learn more about combating burnout, isolation, and anxiety in the remote workplace.

Management
Managing an all-remote company is much like managing any other company. It comes down to trust, communication, and company-wide support of shared goals.

Learn more about what’s required to effectively and efficiently manage an all-remote company.

Forcing functions to work remote-first
Whether it’s unwinding from offices entirely and going all-remote, or attempting to create a level playing field for in-office and remote team members in a hybrid-remote arrangement, leaders should consider key forcing functions to ensure a commitment to remote-first practices.

Learn more about tactical, actionable steps that will send a clear message that leadership is serious about implementing remote in the organization.

Collaboration and whiteboarding with remote teams
“How do you collaborate and whiteboard in a remote environment?” is a frequently asked question. In a colocated setting, collaboration often happens face-to-face with a whiteboard on hand in a conference room. Working remotely sometimes feels like working on your own, with your own calendar, and your own schedule. With a common goal, strategic planning, and the right collaboration tools, working in a remote environment can be even more productive than working in an office.

Learn more about collaboration and whiteboarding in remote work environments.

Remote onboarding
Onboarding remotely should focus on three key dimensions: the organizational, the technical, and the social. By using this integrated approach, top companies enable their employees to stay and thrive in their roles. We’ll show how you can focus on these three key dimensions of onboarding through an all-remote onboarding process.

Learn more in GitLab’s guide to remote onboarding.

Scaling
GitLab believes that all-remote is the future of work, and that it not only works well at scale, but works better at scale than antiquated colocated models.

We’ve also compiled a list of companies that have been inspired by GitLab’s culture.

Hiring
GitLab envisions a world where talented, driven individuals can find roles and seek employment based on business needs, rather than an oftentimes arbitrary location.

Hiring across the globe isn’t without its challenges. There are local regulations and risks unique to countries and regions around the globe. We believe that these challenges are worth overcoming, and opening our talent acquisition pipeline beyond the usual job centers creates a competitive advantage. We hope to see this advantage wane as more all-remote companies are created.

Learn more about hiring in an all-remote environment.

Compensation
While there are certain complexities to paying team members who are spread out in over 50 countries, we believe that it’s worthwhile. Being an all-remote company enables us to hire the world’s best talent, not just the best talent from a few cities.

Learn more about compensation in an all-remote environment.

Learning and Development
We believe that all-remote companies are at a competitive advantage when it comes to educating and developing team members.

Learn more on how to make learning and development a companywide mindset in an all-remote environment.

Self-service
It’s not what you know. It’s knowing where to look. This is true at GitLab and other organizations that are intentional about documenting processes, and it is entirely counter to how typical work environments are structured.

Learn more about the importance of self-searching, self-learning, and self-service in an all-remote organization.

Informal Communication
In an all-remote environment, informal communication should be formally addressed. Leaders should organize informal communication, and to whatever degree possible, design an atmosphere where team members all over the globe feel comfortable reaching out to anyone to converse about topics unrelated to work.

Learn more about enabling informal communication in an all-remote company.

Asynchronous communication
In an all-remote setting, where team members are empowered to live and work where they’re most fulfilled, mastering asynchronous workflows is vital to avoiding dysfunction and enjoying outsized efficiencies. Increasingly, operating asynchronously is necessary even in colocated companies which have team members on various floors or offices, especially when multiple time zones are involved.

Learn more about implementing asynchronous workflows in your organization, and the benefits to both employee and employer.

Handbook-first documentation
A handbook-first organization is home to team members who benefit from having a single source of truth to lean on. This type of organization is able to operate with almost supernatural efficiency. An organization that does not put concerted effort into documenting has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers.

Learn more about the significance of handbook-first documentation.

Meetings
Learn how to decide when a meeting is necessary and how to optimize them in an all-remote environment.

Communicating effectively and responsibly through text
Embracing text communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and vocalized communiques are the norm.

Learn more about mastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting.

In-person interactions
While there are tremendous advantages to operating a 100% remote company, leaders should consider being intentional about planning in-person elements, even if they’re optional for team members.

Learn more about considerations for in-person interactions in a remote company.

Workspace
All-remote enables the creation of a custom office, perfectly tailored for your desires and ergonomic needs.

Learn more about key considerations when building and evolving your remote workspace.

Parenting as a remote worker
Parents who work from home have unique demands and expectations, as well as unique challenges. Being an excellent coworker and an excellent parent is a tall order, particularly when childcare and school are impacted by a global crisis.

Learn more about balancing remote work and parenting.

Stories

Hybrid-remote
Hybrid-remote companies have one or more offices where a subset of the company commutes to each day, paired with a subset of the company that works remotely.

Learn more about advantages, challenges, and the primary differences between all-remote and other forms of remote working.

Comparing All-Remote Benefits vs. Hybrid-Remote Benefits
Learn more about the differences in workplace experience by individuals who are remote by default in an all-remote setting vs. a hybrid-remote setting, working with colleagues who are onsite by default.

Transitioning or adding remote
Learn more about considerations for transitioning a colocated or hybrid-remote company to 100% remote.

What not to do when implementing remote
An organization should not attempt to merely replicate the in-office/colocated experience, remotely.

Learn more about what not to do when transitioning to remote, or moving towards remote.

Working while traveling
Working remotely enables a tremendous amount of freedom, enabling team members to work from anywhere so long as there is a reliable internet connection.

Learn more about optimizing comfort and efficiency when taking your office with you while traveling.

Remote work conferences, summits, and events
Particularly for those who are seeking a new role with an all-remote or remote-first company, events can be a great place to meet others who have experience and connections in the space.

Learn more about remote work conferences and summits, the power of networking, and the unique elements of experiencing a virtual event.

Remote internships
Remote internships are unique in one primary way: there is no physical office involved.

Learn more about considerations for both employee and employer as it relates to remote internships (also referred to as apprenticeships and co-ops).

All-remote Certification
GitLab is a pioneer in the all-remote space. As one of the world’s largest all-remote companies, we have developed a custom certification program to test and apply knowledge attained throughout the all-remote section of the handbook. Emerging leaders must quickly learn and deploy remote-first practices and skills while expanding their knowledge of remote management and overall remote fluency."
Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit ,"Heard:  how to make people feel it (3 min)

Video of Matt explaining Heard:  how to make people feel it (4 min)

When people have a feeling or thought, they want to feel heard. If they don't, they will feel resentment. 
So, how do you make people feel heard? By listening deeply and then actively acknowledging what they say (or even better, what their actual thoughts are).
First, get ready to feel triggered (i.e., anger, fear, sadness). Tell yourself that if these emotions come, they are going to give you bad advice. Instead, imagine a glass case around the person that you are talking to. Anything they say is not going to leave that glass case. None of it hits you.  (This is a critical step, because if you do get triggered, you will not be able to make the person feel heard.  In fact, you will do the opposite.)
Second, ask the person to express what their feelings and thoughts are. Really be present with the person you’re listening to. Put away any distractions. Make it your entire intention to listen fully to understand, not to talk/respond right away.
Third, acknowledge what they said by …
If they are trying to give you feedback (or are simply getting angry at you), then ...
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 

Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  
You can keep going deeper and deeper by repeating this process until the person says “No, that’s it.”  If you allow the person to go all the way down to the core issue, they usually have an ah-ha moment that almost resolves the issue on its own.
If you want to go to the advanced level when repeating back, also describe to them the feeling they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the emotions yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they fear you will get angry if they say what they really think (and then become vindictive). So they have toned down their thought when saying it. If you tone it down, even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, ""Well, it's not that extreme."" But they will feel heard. And they will be safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.
Example:
What was said or written: 
""I wish that you wouldn't act in anger.""


What is likely in their head: 
""Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence!""
Again, say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  (There is almost always more!)
After the above process is complete, to confirm that you have done it correctly, ask the person: ""Do you feel heard?""

        2. If they are sharing a painful thing that is going on in their life ...
Don't repeat back what they said. Instead, say, ""I imagine that you are feeling …."" And then honestly try to imagine what they are feeling and thinking. Express that. 
""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you can even go deeper by asking …
 ""Is there more?""  Or even better …
“There’s more.  Please tell me more.”  Because there is almost always more! 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Please tell me more.""

What if someone won't say what they are feeling or thinking? No worries, you can still make them feel heard. You have to imagine what they are thinking and say that. ""I imagine that you are thinking something like …."" And then, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done.
If they say, ""No,"" ask them what their thoughts are. Now that they have seen that you won't get angry, they are more likely to share. 
If they still don't share, you can try to imagine their thoughts again. Repeat until they do share and you have reflected it correctly.

This is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is more impactful than acting on their feedback, or helping them solve their problem.

Conversely, if you feel that someone you are talking to is not hearing you, you can simply ask them:  “To make sure that I am communicating well, can you please repeat back what you heard me say.”   If that feels too blunt, you can first share with them this document.

Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)
Think about the people you like. Do you like people who talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
If you want to create a meaningful relationship with someone:
Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home.
Ask them lots of questions.
Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you.
When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. They will find it heartwarming to see someone who cares enough about the details of their life to remember them. 
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always enjoy that they took the time to meet.
Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""I would like to develop a real relationship with you."" That intent alone is heartwarming. And will make the person want to invest the time to create that relationship with you.
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the person is likely to say yes. If you have genuinely allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be extensive, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
If you aren't good at reading body language, wait. At some point, the person will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to work with you. Now tell me what your company does."" 
To summarize, the four keys are:
Ask them about their lives.
Prove that you heard them by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""
Let them know what you appreciate about them.
If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond, and you then have a willing partner (i.e., investor, customer, recruit) in whatever your endeavor is.
When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a substantial adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the technique, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective partners and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.
Strengthening the Relationship
Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This connection is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not every one of these rounds needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:
Matt,
Your old house, no??
Peter
http://www.sfgate.com/realestate/walkthrough/article/Soothing-style-welcoming-pool-patio-defines-11023844.php#photo-12599447
I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him. 
Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me. 
Below is another example, a message of appreciation from Bill Trenchard of First Round Capital. 
Hey Matt,
Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!

Bill
I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:
At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as ""the handwritten note guy.""
So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. (Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his iconic blogpost, states that he does this every Friday for one hour. Andy Bromberg does it for a few minutes each day.) You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. 


Please know that the above techniques, and all of those I have written about in relationship-building below, are manipulative. You can use them for good (to create a connection with someone you will treat well) or for bad (to connect with someone you will not treat well). I hope that you will use them for good only.

Relationships:  How to get good at them (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vIiU3-wRphxBLqEBJadAA20tuJhMxa87tFUC2YJs5o/edit ,"Relationships:  How to get good at them (2 min)

Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)
We all want to be good at relationships. Whether we are a CEO, a Manager, or an Individual Contributor, how well we interact with our teammates, customers and investors determine how much positive impact we have. So how do we learn to get good at relationships?
For the answer, I turn to surfing. Learning to surf is hard. Catching a wave is very infrequent, so beginners get a minimal chance to practice on a real wave. Good instructors, therefore, have figured out how to get their students lots of practice on the pieces of surfing that don't require an actual wave. 
There are four parts to surfing: paddling, turning, popping up, and riding. It turns out that you can practice the first three without a wave. So, that's what good instructors do. They have their students practice paddling and turning in flat water and practice popping up on land. Once the student masters those skills, they move to a wave. And, not surprisingly, the student then quickly masters catching and riding the wave. 
The same pattern holds for relationships. We don't get that many touchpoints with our teammates, customers, and investors. In turn, it means that each of those touchpoints is high stakes, so we find it difficult to experiment with a new way. We need a method of getting lots of practice doing relationships (touchpoints) in a low-stakes way. Where can we get that?
Do you have children, a significant other, a friend, or a parent? The answer, of course, is yes. Well, then, there is your practice ground. Relationships with humans (teammates, customers, or investors) are no different than relationships with humans (children, spouse, friends, or family members). Get good at your relationship with your spouse or children, and you will discover that you learn all the skills needed to develop a great relationship with your teammates or customers.
If you choose to practice with your spouse, you can:
Ask your spouse if he is interested in learning this with you. (He will say ""Yes!"")
Go on Amazon and choose a book to read and study together (get two copies). Here are some excellent options: 
Hold Me Tight
Communication Miracles for Couples
Take a course. Either in a group over a weekend or 1-1 with the teacher.

How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bF88nIzZGJT9NTDXK6IR1ZzRCBqYMr8NK_No8nM0aI/edit ,"How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min)

As CEO, it is critical to have a personal connection with your team. They need to know that you care about them before they care about the work they do for you. 
When in the office, this personal connection is relatively easy to maintain. You say hello to them each morning and goodbye to them each evening when you leave. You see them at lunchtime and ask them about their lives. 
But how do you maintain that connection when there are no informal in-person interactions that serve as prompts to say these ""hellos,"" ""goodbyes,"" and ""what is going on in your life""? 
Create your own prompts.
First, get to know some personal information about each person on your team (the name of their spouse, their children, their pets, where they grew up, what they like to do for fun).  You can create a Personal Info, Team - example (1 min) and ask people to enter their information there.
Then, schedule some time each week (I recommend one hour per week) to reach out to various members of your community (work team, investors, family, friends) and let them know that you are thinking of them. The message need not be long. The only intent is to let them know that you are thinking about them.
Here are some examples:
""Thinking of you. Hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke are doing well.""
""I saw this article on tennis and thought of you.""
That's it. The message need not be long nor elaborate. The only purpose is to let your colleague know that you are thinking about them and remember the important things about their life. 
It takes very little time, and it is massively effective. 
You are likely thinking: ""Matt, this is such an obvious ploy. My people will see right through it.""
If so, to you, I reply: ""Many of my coachees still send me messages like this. I know exactly what they are doing. Hell, I'm the one who showed them how to do it. And yet, I appreciate it every time. Because I know that they intend to create a connection with me and that always feels good.""
Another anecdote: The best operating CEO I've ever known, who self-admittedly doesn't have much emotional intelligence at all, once asked me: ""Matt, please help me to be more empathetic and create an emotional connection with my team."" So, I gave him the advice above. Being the best operator, he immediately and faithfully followed the advice. 
A month later, I facilitated a 2-day offsite for him and his executive team. When, at one point, he left the room, the entire executive team turned to me, and said ""How did you do it? He used to be a robot. And then about 30 days ago, he suddenly turned into this super-caring, super-compassionate guy."" And they started sharing with me examples of ways that he reached out to them in a very personal way. ""I was on the airplane with my family getting ready to go to my parents' house for Thanksgiving when I got a text from him saying: 'I hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke have a great time with your parents in Michigan. Safe travels.' I was blown away.""
Listening to all this was the newest executive hire, who had only just come on board. She was shocked. ""You mean he wasn't like this two months ago? I just went through the recruiting process with him and concluded that he is the most empathetic CEO I have ever known or even heard of.""

There are several ways to create a trusted relationship between a Manager and her reports.
They include:
I notice and recognize the contributions you make.
I ask and remember the details about you as a human being.
I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers.
I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker.
I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution).
Let's dive deeper into each one.
Recognition
I notice and recognize the contributions you make. This action is quite simply Praise (13 min). Do it in every single 1-1, Team Meeting and All Hands Meeting. Carve out an amount of time (3-5 minutes) to declare this praise. 
In addition, I send direct messages to people each week, or even each day, to follow up and give appreciations (1 min). I block off one hour each week to do so. 
Personal relationship
I know and care about you as a human being. 
To show this on a superficial (but still meaningful) level, I ask and remember the details about you as a human being. 
This action creates Trust and Like (5 min). 
Collect this information in the next 1-1 that you have with each Report.

I want to help you solve the challenges you face in your personal life, not just those in your work life. 
When asking about issues that you are facing in our 1-1s, I explicitly ask you about personal challenges that you are facing. I then help you unpack those and give them as much air-time as work issues.

Praise (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFhFbtIxmUdrUe9y341ghd-EJ89hJZ7g9tOKnw16FI/edit ,"Praise (3 min)
Motivation is a tricky thing. If you're a CEO or Manager, how do you create it in your team members? How do you maintain it?
Luckily, most people arrive in a job or a relationship with lots of motivation. So, your only job is to help them maintain it. 
Jordan Petersen observes that if someone does something willfully or intentionally to break the rules or not meet the standards of performance, and you call them out on it, they almost feel relief. They know that they didn't perform, and it's almost comforting to know that you noticed. You haven't hurt the person. 
By contrast, if you want to hurt somebody, find someone earnestly trying and chastise them for something they didn't do as you wanted. You will crush them. 
Now, of course, none of us wants to hurt anybody nor crush their motivation. The key then is to realize that nearly EVERYONE around us is trying. Our team members, our spouse, our kids, our parents, and our siblings. Nearly EVERYONE.
Treat them as such. 
Right now, you are likely thinking: ""So, how do I get them to do what I want if I can't point out what they're doing wrong?"" 
Do the inverse. Point out what they are doing right!!! Thank them for it. ""Thank you for doing …."" Describe a specific action that they did, not a general personality trait. 
Good: 
""Thank you for sending out all the board materials one week before the board meeting."" 
""Thank you for doing the dishes last night.""
Not good: 
""Thank you for being so conscientious."" 
""Thank you for being so helpful.""
It may seem simple. But it's potent.
Every time you notice them doing something right, point it out. They will glow with satisfaction that you noticed what they did and that they are trying. Then they will be eager to do even more that is positive. They may even ask you what else they can do. But even if they don't, they will continue to do that one thing that you praised.
As time goes on, notice and praise other things. You are giving them confidence and motivation. Very quickly, you will see their overall performance improve.
And note that these praisings do not have to be lengthy nor in person. You can send a text. It often takes less than one minute to write. You can even make this a regular habit: once a week, or even once a day. 
At some point, maybe after 4-8 interactions of praise, they will build a sense of trust that you genuinely appreciate them and want to be in a lasting relationship with them. Once that happens, you have the leeway to point out things that you wish they would do differently (which is best done synchronously, not via text). But never forget to continue to praise as well. 
I encourage you to experiment with this at home first. Try it with a child or spouse. I predict that you will experience magic.

"Trust, Deep (2 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IB7YDr_trYKavL_RdWTb8ddJt77eqDH_6H5BsK416FM/edit# ,"Trust, Deep (2 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about building trust (5 min)
In a group ...
I coach many of the CEOs of the fastest-growing tech companies in the Bay Area. I host a monthly gathering of these CEOs, where they can share their challenges and get both tactical advice and emotional support. These CEOs have access to many other CEO groups because their investors are all in the top tier, and every top tier investor hosts such groups. But they tell me that they choose to attend my group over the others because my group is the one in which they trust the other participants most. Why?
In every group that I convene, each member must share something deeply shameful about themselves. When I first announce this, there is nervous silence. So, I go first. I share something quite horrific. And then I ask each person, ""Do you feel more or less connected to me? If so, why?"" Without exception, they all say ""More"" and then something like, ""Because I appreciate that you were willing to reveal yourself to me that way. What you did/thought/said is very human. I think in the same circumstances, I likely would have done the same thing.""
(Fear tells us never to reveal anything shameful. It tells us that if we do, people will be disgusted by us and never want to associate with us again. But my reveal proves otherwise.)
Then, I ask each person to share something equally painful. They do. But only because I have gone first and proved that revealing something truly vulnerable creates connection rather than destroying it. 
An example of something that I am ashamed of:
I preach that Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min), that you should never act in anger. And yet, I act in anger regularly. Several years ago, when I was coaching little league baseball, a parent was very competitive and wanted me to run many more practices. Still, he refused to participate (while nearly every other parent pitched in). After the season was over, he called me to tell me that I should never have volunteered to be a coach because if I hadn't, then his son would have landed on a team with a coach that was actually committed. Rather than listen and learn, I asked him, ""Where are you right now? I want to know so that I can tell you to your face what a f*(&ing asshole you are."" The only thing this accomplished was to create a rift in the town's society. From then on, people had to decide whether they would hang out with him or me. 
When listening to such a story, the key is to listen and appreciate only. The person revealing is not asking you to help them solve a problem. Instead, they are showing what they believe to be a character flaw. They want to know if you still accept them as they are. If you try to help them problem-solve, then you are saying, ""This character flaw is not acceptable. You must fix it for me to accept you."" If, on the other hand, you say ""Tell me more"" or ""Thank you for sharing that with me. I feel closer to you now."" then they will feel accepted as they are.
If you are willing to try this out, each member will likely feel deep trust toward all the others by the end of the first meeting. After that, sharing challenges from work and personal life is easy. 
1-1 …
The method works equally well 1-1. 
Peter Fenton is universally considered to be the best relationship-builder in the tech investing world. How does he do it?
One, he truly cares about people. But that isn't so unique. There are plenty of people who genuinely care, and they are great relationship-builders. 
So what makes Peter the best?
I posit that it is because he openly shares how flawed he is as a human being. When I first met Peter, within 5 minutes, he had told me things that felt like his deepest, darkest secrets. My instant thought was, ""I love this guy! He's not telling me how great he is. Instead, he's telling me how broken he is. He's so humble."" 
I then talked to other people that knew Peter, and each had had a similar experience when they met him. He shared his flaws with them…and they loved him for it!
Peter does not do this as a technique. He is very open about his flaws. And the world has rewarded him for it.

Fundraising- The Relationship Method (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/163t4I3CzQ-CUScBYp6fCxpboSgHxCB7syd4Jtzw7nco/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Fundraising: The Relationship Method (8 min)
Introductions
The introduction is a vital part of the fundraising process, and you only get one chance at it. I recommend using the Triangulation Method.
When you want to be introduced to an investor, first find three to five people in your network who know that person. Then ask each to send an email to the target investor, letting her know how great they think you are, and highly recommending that she meet with you. After receiving several such emails, the investor will proactively reach out to you. She has received recommendations before, but never three or more for the same person. She concludes that you and your company must be truly great, so she is already inclined to invest in you before she even meets you.
From your side, stack all of the referrals in a short period (within a week). You are trying to achieve critical mass and have your referrals rise above the noise of other referrals. 
It's important not to hand each referrer the same potential text to send onward. If they end up sending the same language, then the referrals are revealed to be orchestrated by you. Therefore, either give your referrers different suggested language or no suggestion at all.
Two Methods
There are two ways to raise money: the Traditional Method and the Relationship Method.
The Traditional Method is when you pitch an investment firm with your story, most often with a slide deck, describing the customer problem, solution, market size, unit economics, financial projections, competition, team members, traction, go-to-market strategy, and so on. You might run through your presentation dozens of times before you find a spark of interest in either you or your company.
The Relationship Method is to build a trusting, friendly relationship with an investor before discussing what your company does. This process takes more time, but it dramatically increases the close rate. This strategy works because we are most often guided by our emotional responses no matter how rational we appear. We make instinctive, gut choices, and our rational brains do an excellent job of retrofitting logic over those choices.
The first time you talk about your company, the investor will decide whether or not she wants to invest. If she does not yet like or trust you, then your company had better be optically perfect—and more often than not, it isn't. So, the key is to wait to talk about your company until you are sure that the investor likes and trusts you personally. By then, the investor will have a positive bias toward you and will be inclined to invest in your company, warts and all. 

But how do you get the investor to like and trust you?
Build trust and like
Think about the people you like. Do you want people who just talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?
When meeting potential investors for the first time, ask them about themselves. Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home. Ask them lots of questions. Prove to them you're listening by saying, ""I think I heard you say…"" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you. When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.
At your next meeting with them, say, ""The last time we talked, you said…"" and again repeat the highlights. It is heartwarming when we find someone who cares enough about the details of our lives to remember them.
Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always appreciate that they took the time to meet with you.
But how do you get a meeting in the first place without the explicit purpose of talking about your company? You can use the Triangulation Method outlined above, but if you don't have enough mutual acquaintances, you can simply ask for it. Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, ""We only want to work with investors with whom we have a good relationship. So let's start with a coffee to get to know each other personally."" 
After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the investor is likely to say yes. If you have truly allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.
These meetings do not need to be long, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it. 
You can then talk about your company with the confidence that they are already inclined to invest. If you aren't good at reading body language, just wait. At some point, they will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): ""I really like you. I want to invest in you. Now tell me what your company does."" 
To summarize, the four keys are:
Ask them about their lives.
Prove that you heard by saying, ""I think I heard you say ...:""
Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, ""The last time we talked, you said ….""
Let them know what you appreciate about them.
If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond and have a willing investor.
When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a strong adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the method, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective investors and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.
Strengthening the Relationship
Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not everyone needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:
Matt,
Your old house, no??
Peter
http://www.sfgate.com/realestate/walkthrough/article/Soothing-style-welcoming-pool-patio-defines-11023844.php#photo-12599447
I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him. 
Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me. 
Below is another example, a message of appreciation, which comes from a Managing Partner at one of the most successful investment firms in the world. 
Hey Matt,
Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon!
Bill
I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, Founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:
At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as ""the handwritten note guy.""
So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. Andy suggests making this a formal process—he says, ""Every day I review all my interactions and send (or schedule) thank you's as appropriate. It ensures I don't miss anyone and am prompt. And it takes literally a few minutes.""
Sell Yourself, Not Your Company
Cliff Weitzman, CEO of Speechify, realized that it was key to sell himself and not his company. If he could do so, he would gain investors for life—investors who would follow him through every pivot and company. So, when Cliff realized that he had established trust and like, he shared the story of his life—using a method that his brother Tyler had discovered.
Tyler Weitzman, CEO of BlackSMS, is a unique guy. He likes to research social situations. As an undergrad at Stanford, he explored a method for conveying one's achievements (or bragging, if you prefer!) while remaining humble and relatable. Through countless interviews of master storytellers, Tyler determined the ultimate structure for humbly telling one's story:
- Credit: ""It could not have happened without [name the others involved].""
- Hard Work: ""We had to put in so much to make it happen, for example, [describe the hard work].""
- Vulnerability: ""It was most difficult for me when….""
- Duty: ""Our dream drove us to [noble motive].""
- Gratitude: ""I am so proud and thankful that….""
I encourage you to tell your story to a friend using this exact structure. See what comes out. Ask your friend for her reaction. I think you will be amazed.
Here is an example of this method:
Acknowledgment
This book could not have happened without all the people that I have coached, and who coach me, including Chris Barber, Misha Talavera, Karissa Paddie, Ryan Breslow, Alex MacCaw, Naval Ravikant, Brian Armstrong, Tatiana Dorow, Alexander Kasser, and Stephen Mochary. 
We each had to put in so much to make this book happen. Chris Barber ""found"" me and invited me to coach his roommates at Stanford, which launched my coaching career. Misha,  Ryan and Alex, whom I coached, forced me to get these writings into the world. Naval read the draft and said it was the best business book he'd seen (whether true or not, that's what he told me), further encouraging me to get it out into the world. My wife, Tatiana Dorow, well, she just makes my life great by making me laugh each and every day. Alexander Kasser, my grandfather, made me feel that I could never fail, no matter how hard I swung the bat. And Stephen Mochary, my dad, has always been my best friend and biggest fan.
Writing this book was most difficult for me when it was almost done. I very much enjoyed writing the content. But the final stages of editing and formatting felt like ""work."" Luckily, Alex pushed me through those tasks.
As a group, what drove us was our dream of sharing this information with the world so that CEOs and companies could be more efficient and effective. 
I am so proud and thankful that I got a chance to work with this amazing group of people. My wish for you is that you, too, get the chance to experience the joy of coaching others one day. It is the most deeply satisfying activity that I have yet found in life. (If you know of anything more satisfying, please let me know!)

Most companies are so focused on improving that they forget to celebrate. But celebration, like fun, is a key to building positive morale. Celebration doesn't mean lavish drunken parties. Quite the opposite, celebration means taking a moment to appreciate the good that the company has achieved, as well as the good that departments, teams, and individuals have achieved. 
To celebrate:
Publicly acknowledge these achievements at All Hands and team meetings. 
Remember to celebrate the essential but often overlooked teams on the core product. 
You don't need to celebrate every team at every meeting. Create a rotation.
Create a standing demo meeting where teams can show off their most recent creations. 
This demo should not be a mandatory meeting but should occur over a meal (lunch) or drinks (Friday afternoon).

Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzF-otDuBWKC2GShJKcFsxCyabK1V3skQwCMU89tDmY/edit# ,"Conflict Resolution (aka Relationship-Building) (10 min)

Interpersonal conflict arises often. And almost always it is due to people:
Not fully sharing their feelings and thoughts.
Not feeling heard. 
There is a laughably simple method for solving this issue. Stephen Covey shared the technique in his iconic The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change. Michael Rosenberg codified it in Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life. And Chris Voss showed its effectiveness in his excellent Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It. I recommend reading all three of these books to get fully immersed in their techniques, but here is the thousand-foot view:
When people distrust or dislike each other, usually, it is because they don't feel heard. For me to respect you, I don't need for you to agree with me. But I do need for you to listen to what I have to say. When I tell you my perspective (which I, of course, believe to be right) and you aren't immediately convinced, I assume you didn't hear or understand what I said. If you start sharing your perspective, I will be uncompelled and unwilling to truly listen because you haven't been willing to consider mine. And the cycle spirals downward to distrust and dislike.
There is a simple fix. You only need to prove to me that you have ""heard"" me. And to do that, you only need to repeat back what I've said in summary form by saying ""I think I heard you say …"" until I say, ""That's right!"" Then I will feel heard. I will now be open to hearing what you have to say. 
(Here is an experiment that proves this principle. The next time you encounter a person repeating themselves, stop them and ask if you can state back what they've already said. They will say ""yes."" You then summarize what they've said and ask if you got it right. If they say ""yes"" again, then watch to see if they continue to repeat themselves. They will not.)
To resolve conflict, you only need to get each person to state their deepest, darkest thoughts and then prove that each has heard what the other has said. This action can be done verbally or in writing. I far prefer the written method as it takes about ⅓ the time, requires almost no facilitation (i.e., it's easy to stay on the script), and the action items that come out of it are impeccable agreements.
If you are the facilitator, here's how it works (the written method):
Step 1: Ask each person to write down their deepest thoughts about the other person.
Participants, please open up a Doc. Please give me (the facilitator) access, but do not give access to the other person yet. 


On the doc, write five categories: 
Anger (present)
Fear (future)
Sadness (past)
Joy (present and past)
Excitement (future)


In every significant relationship, we have feelings of Anger, Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement. When you think about the other person and focus on the anger you feel, what thoughts come to mind? Please write those thoughts in the following way: 
Feeling: Anger
Story: The thought that I had was …. 
(By framing this as a thought or story in your head, it takes away the sting of judgment, because you are sharing that this is just a thought that you have, not the absolute truth.)
Request: Please do or say …. 
(An action that the other can take to address this situation entirely.)


Here is an example: 
Feeling: Anger 
Story: I thought that you purposely ignored me and thus were really saying ""Screw you!"" to me.
Request: From now on, when you walk by me, please say ""hello.""


As the facilitator, look at both docs and make sure that the participants fill them out correctly. Make sure that requests are explicit and that the participants can take verifiable actions.
If one or both are reluctant to say anything, which is often the case, you supply the thoughts you might have if you were in their shoes. Be dramatic. Become an actor. Get into the role. State the thoughts as explicitly as they would appear in your mind. Use swear words.
The person will start to guide you. They are likely to say: ""That's close, but not quite it. The thoughts I have are more like …"" When they slow down or don't seem willing to go further, again state the thoughts for them. Each time you do so, it allows them to go further. Do this until each person has written down their raw, unvarnished thoughts around anger toward the other. Once they get that right, they can usually get through Fear, Sadness, Joy, and Excitement on their own.


Now ask each participant to cut and paste the Joy and Excitement sections to the top of the doc. For the person sharing their emotions and thoughts, it is hard to feel Joy and Excitement until they have first written down their thoughts around Anger and Fear. But when the recipient reads the doc, it is best to see how the sharer actually has positive thoughts about the recipient. This action validates the relationship and motivates the recipient to do what is needed to repair that relationship. Therefore, the recipient needs to read the thoughts around Joy and Excitement first.
Step 2: Person A (with less power in the relationship) shares access to their doc with Person B.
Person A says out loud her stories around Joy and Excitement to Person B. Person B should simply say ""thank you"" to Person A when she hears these thoughts.


Person B then reads through Person A’s stories around Sadness, Fear or Anger to Person B.   She picks the one the feels biggest, and asks Person A to say that one out loud.


Person B then makes Person A feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).  This is the key step!!
Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" Summarize what they said or wrote. Then say, ""Is that right?"" If they say, ""Yes,"" you are done. 
If they say, ""Not quite,"" ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. 
Once you have correctly summarized what they said, you can even go deeper by asking, ""Is there more?""  If they share more, go back to step a.
Repeat the above process until Person A says “No, that’s it.”
You, the facilitator, then follow this script:


The facilitator asks Person B: ""Do you want to make Person A feel Anger and have these thoughts?"" 
Person B: ""No."" 
If the answer is ""yes,"" then the two should not be in a relationship together. That means that one will likely need to be let go from the organization. Regardless of seniority, the person to be let go should usually be the person who wants the other to feel anger. That person will likely create toxic relationships with others and eventually will have to leave the company anyway.


Facilitator to Person A: ""What request do you have of Person B?"" 
Person A: ""Please do the following: ….""


If Person B agrees, have Person B write down the action item (with their initials and due date) just below the fact/judgment of Person A.
The goal is to co-create a plan so that misunderstanding and anger do not enter the relationship again. Person A goes first. Person B adds their thoughts. They go back and forth until they have agreed on a written plan.
Verbal agreements are not impeccable. We all understand words a little bit differently. To make this agreement impeccable, one of the participants writes down the plan, and the other adds their initials and a ""+1"" to note their agreement. 
Facilitator to Person A: ""Do you feel heard? Do you feel that Person B wants to have a positive relationship with you?""
Person A: ""Yes.""
If the answer is ""no,"" get curious and find out why. Repeat the steps above until the answer is ""yes.""
Do not move on to a second Anger item yet.
Step 3: Person B shares access to their doc with Person A.
Repeat the same script as in Step 2. 
Now both Person A and Person B have:
affirmed that they want to be in a positive relationship with each other.
accepted the feedback and created an action item to resolve it.
Step 4: When the ""ah-ha"" moment of understanding occurs, seal it with a physical connection: a handshake, a high-five, a hug.
When Step 3 is complete, there will usually be a moment of understanding and compassion for each other. When this moment occurs, seal it with a physical connection. If the two have hugged in the past, ask them to do so again now. If the most they have done in the past is shake hands or high-five, then ask them to do that now. This physical connection symbolizes the new understanding and puts a capstone on the event.
Step 5: Ask each person for feedback on the process.
What did you like that I (as facilitator) did? 


What did you wish that I had done differently?
Step 6: Set a meeting for 1-2 weeks out between Person A, Person B, and the Facilitator. 
If the first meeting was rocky, schedule a 1-1 with each participant before the second group meeting. During these 1-1s, help each person share their deepest thoughts, stay on script and view the feedback they receive as a gift.


At the second group meeting, confirm that both Person A and B have completed their action items. This step will prove to each other that there is a genuine desire for a positive relationship.


Do Steps 2-4 on the remainder of issues identified under Anger and Fear for each person.
In my experience, when two people, who previously hated each other, have shared their thoughts (and been heard) around all five of the basic emotions they feel toward the other, the two create an understanding and respect for each other even if they still do not agree with the others' positions. Please let me know if you experience something different.

"Listening Tours, by Ian Tien (5 min)",https://medium.com/@it33/leadership-listening-tours-llts-for-remote-work-22b236ca2d16 ,"Missing hallway conversations? Try Remote Listening Tours (RLTs)
Remote Listening Tours (“RLTs”) help remote leaders get a better sense of how people are thinking, feeling and operating.
Ian Tien


In the 1970s, there was a management technique catching on called Managing By Wandering Around (“MBWA”), where senior executives would wander around buildings to talk to employees to get a sense of how organizations were thinking, feeling and operating.

With remote work, leaders lose their ability to wander. Because of this, we’re more prone to getting isolated from our organizations, to losing context, and to limiting our perspectives to filtered reports and meeting commentary.

To do our version of wandering remotely, at Mattermost we use Remote Listening Tours (“RLTs”). RLTs are skip-level small group conversations where leaders, particularly the CEO, can hear feedback and input from a handful of people on a semi-random cadence. RLTs give leaders a sense of sentiment, alignment, and more context on what’s on people’s minds. Personally, these meetings are some of the most impactful conversations that I have in a week.

The original concept was shared to us by one of our investors who used it in an in-office environment, and we adjusted it for remote work.

Below I’m sharing some adapted documentation on how we do CEO Listening Tours for our company, in case this could be helpful to yours:

CEO Listening Tour (sample documentation)
The following documentation is shared to our staff in advance. It’s also shared in the meeting invite for the Listening Tour. If it’s helpful, please feel free to use and adapt it.

Listening to feedback and input is vital to continually improving everything we do. We want to listen a lot. We have 1–1s with managers and skip-levels, regular pulse and engagement surveys, People team outreach and conversations, and anonymous feedback available in every all-hands meeting.

CEO Listening Tours are another way we listen.

CEO Listening Tours happen over video calls around 25 to 30 minutes in length with different groups of 5 to 8 staff, typically within the same department or in a related function. Managers of team members in the group are typically not included in the meeting. It’s a time set aside for the CEO to listen directly to colleagues across the company.

Some notes about Listening Tours:

It’s an opportunity to hear from staff about their likes and wishes. What’s one thing you like that’s happening? What’s one thing you wish we might do differently? Likes and wishes could be about your team, your department or the company in general. These could be items off the top of your head, or maybe something you’ve been thinking about for a while. No need to over think things. There’s no wrong answer, this is just a chance for people to share thoughts with the group.
The priority of the meeting is listening. During these sessions the CEO takes notes and refrains from commentary, though may ask follow-up questions. Notes are “default open” to be shared with managers, executives, and anyone in the company.
We end by confirming people are heard. At the end of the session the CEO reads back what they heard to verify people’s input was accurately captured, and to see if there’s more to share. The notes are shared with the management chain who weren’t in the meeting. It’s up to managers to decide if they’d like to ask for more feedback based on the likes and wishes shared, or if any adjustments should be made. The CEO may also incorporate the information at the company level. In the past, participants and managers of listening tours have found the meetings productive for uncovering blindspots at the company and within departments.
If you’re not able to make a particular listening meeting, please ping [coordinator contact] to add you to a different slot.

That’s roughly we how we do ours at the time of this writing. We continually adjust our process as we go. There’s lots of articles on in-person listening tours to draw from as you hone your own version.

Personally, I don’t think there’s a full substitute for managing by walking around — technology is still far from replacing in-person experiences. However, I do believe management is a profession, and the better tools we have to ply our craft, the better our results can be.

My hope is Remote Listening Tours might offer an idea or two for remote managers.

Does your company do some form of remote listening tour today? Would love to hear your feedback in comments. What do you like about how your company listens? What do you wish they might do differently?

UPDATE: To add: It’s important to over-communicate about Remote Listening Tours, in email, at an all-hands meeting, in the meeting invite, and in a pre-amble at the start of each session. Especially if you have senior leaders doing skip levels, or skip-skip levels, etc. you want to make sure people have context on the meeting and aren’t surprised."
Love Meeting (5 min including video),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcZz5WQlIzIhRWL37Knha6eutCkBMXv8KAIFZl5IdPs/edit ,"Love Meeting (5 min including video)        
People who feel emotions strongly (anger, fear, sadness) need an effective way to release those emotions. One of the most effective ways is to speak aloud for a few minutes about what is causing them anger, fear, or sadness. Once they do this, much of the emotion is released, and they feel better. 
Most people benefit from such a release after a long day of living (work, kids, etc.). If you have a spouse or a partner, one of the greatest gifts you can give them is an offer to be the listener for such a release. 
If you make such an offer and it is accepted, the key is to be ""present"" while your partner talks and not interject with suggestions or advice. If you give advice, you kill the person's stream of consciousness and end the release. This action is very frustrating for the talker. They don't want solutions; they just want to release. 
So, your only job during such a session is to listen actively.  
In its most basic form, active listening is: 
Being present 
Turn off all devices (phone, laptop, etc.)
Look at the person talking
Breath


Not interjecting 
Do not talk! 
Do not give advice or suggestions. 
Just listen!
In a more advanced form, you can show that you hear both the words and their emotions. When your partner expresses something frustrating, allow yourself to feel the frustration and allow your face to reflect that emotion. Similarly, for sadness, anger, and fear, or whatever emotion they are expressing.
As the listener, it may feel daunting to be present and listen for an indeterminate amount of time. What if your partner keeps talking for hours? The answer, of course, is that they won't. Usually, after 10-15 minutes, your partner will likely be talked out, emotionally released, and feeling much better (and feeling connected to you!). 
The first time you do this, I recommend that you just let it go as long as it needs to. If you decide to make this a regular part of your life, know that it will require less and less time over time.
For a visual demonstration of what to and not to do (and why), watch this 2-minute video called Nail in the Head.
I call such a listening meeting a Love Meeting. My wife and I do it regularly. And it magically creates a deep connection between us.

Trust:  How to create it among peers (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKLDirgPz4VYnPe1Z3S7mHc9enkPOPVtKwfBwq05z48/edit ,"Trust:  How to create it among peers (2 min)
""Matt, I'm able to create trust and like with my reports (or partners) by following your methods, but how do I get my exec team members (or partners) to create trust and like amongst themselves?""
What worked for you will work for them. You just have to guide the exec team to it.
First, please read these docs on how to create trust and like with your reports/partners to make sure that you're following all of the steps:
Trust and Like (5 min)
Relationships: How to get good at them (2 min)
How to maintain personal connection in a remote world (3 min)
Appreciation (1 min)
Praise (2 min)
Relationships - How to create a good one between a Manager and her Reports (3 min; 60 min for the links)
Next, help your partners or exec team walk through these same motions with each other. Here's how:
Create a sheet with Personal Info, Team - example (1 min). Put in your information. Then share it with your team and ask them to do the same.
Encourage your team members to ask each other about their personal lives using this info. This action allows everyone to get to know each other as humans and feel seen and cared for as a real person, rather than just a work contributor. You can model this in the first few minutes of each team meeting by: 
Asking one or two members about their personal life (yes, in front of everyone else … and rotating who you ask), or
Asking each person to spend 30 seconds verbally sharing a highlight from their personal life since the group met last. 
Once the team is doing the baby steps above and finding value, share with the team the readings above. Ask each team member to reach out to one another between meetings. You can even require it, as Gitlab does, through its Donuts tool: Remote: Gitlab's Guide to All-Remote (a while to read)
At an offsite, you can go deeper.  
Start with light Icebreakers
Then move to deeper exercises, like Trust, Deep (2 min). 
Please give this work a few hours. It will be scary. Hire someone to facilitate the process if you don't want to do it yourself. But get it done. Once you do, it will forever bond your team.
If you do hire a facilitator, they should be in person with you.  (I have experimented with facilitating a session where I was remote and the team was in person.  It did not work, because the team couldn’t sense the depth of my emotion when I shared my shameful thought.)
Keep the connection going by implementing a regular practice of peer feedback using this Feedback Form 1-1 (4 min). The cadence should be at least quarterly, hopefully monthly, and best bi-weekly (rotating the pairs which give each other feedback). 
If you follow all of these steps, it will deeply bond your team for the long term.

Mistakes happen. We all make them. But how do we make things right once we realize that we've made a mistake?
Three steps. Repair, Rewind, Redo.
Repair
The first thing to do is acknowledge: 
what I did
the damage that it caused
that I did not intend to cause that damage
make a commitment that I will not do that action again. 
""From now on in that situation, I will …""


Rewind
""Now, I'd like to go back in time and do it the way I plan on doing it from now on.”


Redo
Redo the statement or the action in the new way.


This process allows others to see that you recognize the damage you did, that you did not intend to cause that damage, and that you are able and willing to do it in a non-damaging way.

Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pGR1sc5IlFXxXE9ve_RrvE1MVWpoYR7CxSyPL6wHQk/edit ,"Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min)


“I have decided to hire a CRO and layer my VP of Sales.  Now I need to tell my VP of Sales.  He will likely be devastated.  But I want him to stay, as he does a fine job on the sales side, just not on the marketing side.  How do I deliver the message without causing him to leave?”

There will always come a moment when you have to deliver news that the recipient will not like.  It will be a difficult conversation.  Here’s how to have it …

First, prepare by reading the Giving Feedback section in Feedback.  

Second, ask if the person is available to talk.

“I’d like to talk to you Sam.  Is now a good time?”    If not, ask “When would be a good time?”
This conversation should happen synchronously (in person, or on a video or audio call), not asynchronously.   It’s important to see or hear the person’s emotional reaction to your message. 

Third, when you begin the meeting, start by letting the person know that this will be a difficult conversation.

“This is going to be a difficult conversation.  You are likely going to feel some combination of anger, fear and sadness.”

Why?  Because the times when we go into deepest fear and anger are when we are surprised.  But if we get a warning that something negative is about to occur, we can mentally prepare just a little bit, and then the surprise and the feelings of fear and anger are not nearly as large.

Fourth, clearly state the difficult thing.


“I am going to hire a CRO and will ask you to report to them.”

Do not lead up to this.  Get the punchline out first so that the person knows that this decision has already been made, and does not try to lobby you.  This is … ripping the band-aid off in one stroke.

Fifth, briefly explain why.

“I am doing this because our customers need … “

This should not be a long explanation.  Just 2-3 bullet points.  At this point, the person listening has likely gone into some version of fear, anger or sadness.  Their brain is not fully functioning, so they have a limited capacity to hear and process.  Therefore, keep it short.

Sixth, ask them for their thoughts and feelings.  

“I imagine that you are likely feeling anger, fear or sadness.  I’d like to know your feelings and thoughts.  Are you open to sharing them with me?”

The person will likely have lots of feelings and thoughts.  Stating those thoughts will allow the person to release them just a bit. 

Seventh, whatever they say, make them feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).

“I think I heard you say ….  Am I close?”

You do not need to act on their thoughts, just let them know that you understand their thoughts.  That’s all.  This will allow the person to let go of some of their harsher feelings.  Not entirely.  But enough that they likely won’t act rashly.  



Eighth, if you are able to help the person achieve what they truly want (ie- find another great job, etc), do so.

That’s it.

Recruiting and Onboarding (15 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHHQok1GAPpUdx_apA_M6RWB7753zbBhac8-9H2dG_M/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Recruiting and Onboarding (15 min)
When recruiting, the goal is to find great people and attract them to your company. Since this is so important, you could rationalize throwing lots and lots of time at this problem, which most growing companies do. Unfortunately, this time-suck will grind most of your other functions to a halt. 
The key is efficiency. And to be efficient, you must spend as little time as possible with the candidates you don't hire (quick evaluation) and as much time as possible with the candidates you want to and do hire (building a relationship, onboarding/training). Remember that each minute you spend with a candidate you don't hire is a minute that you aren't spending with the team member you want to hire.
Of all the recruiting systems I have seen, the best description is in the book Who by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. I have summarized the Recruiting System in Appendix B. If this system resonates with you, I highly recommend reading the book Who in its entirety to understand the details. 
The key in this system is that predictive information does not come from the interviews themselves. There are plenty of people who are good at interviewing but do not perform in the job. Instead, the predictive information comes from how a person actually performs or how they have performed in the past. 
If the person is not currently in a full-time job, hire them on a contract basis to work with you for 1-3 months. You will then see how they actually perform. This step is the most predictive information you can collect.
But most good people are already in a full-time job and are loathe to leave it unless they are offered another full-time job. For these people, the key is to collect information about how they have performed in previous jobs. And the best way to do that is through extensive reference interviews. 
Therefore, the goal of the in-person interview becomes primarily to collect the names and contact of the people that the candidate has worked for and with throughout their career (top-grading interview). The hiring manager then uses this list to reach out to 5-7 people to conduct reference interviews. And this is where you discover the predictive information. 
Before Recruiting
As the hiring manager, write out a ninety-day roadmap for the position you need to fill. This roadmap includes all the goals you expect the new team member to hit within the first ninety days of joining. This action is critical for successful onboarding. During the interview process, share this roadmap with the candidate to make sure that she is excited about these goals.
Selling

The best candidates will get offers from other companies. So, you need to not only evaluate but also sell from the very beginning.
Building a relationship
Just as in fundraising, building a relationship with a recruit will vastly increase her likelihood of joining your company. The best candidates can work anywhere. Make sure that they want to work with you.
Do this by using the same techniques mentioned earlier. Ask the candidate about herself, reflect on what she says, and remember what she said the next time you meet with her. If you have already used this method during your initial fundraising, you will know its effectiveness. 
Speed
There is another critical variable to making the recruit want to accept your offer: speed! A recruit wants to feel loved. The easiest way to accomplish that is to have a fast process from start to finish. Each day of delay sends the message, ""We don't have conviction about you."" 
If you doubt whether this dynamic exists, recall when you raised money. Which investors were the most compelling for you? The ones that responded and decided quickly, or those that lingered in their decision process for weeks or months? Benchmark and Sequoia are famous for making investment offers within days (and sometimes hours) of meeting a company that excites them. 
The offer from investors is always pending due diligence, so there is plenty of time after-the-fact for the investment firm to discover critical information about your company. In recruiting, you also can make an offer to the candidate ""pending reference interviews."" 
Here's what a streamlined process looks like:
You contact a candidate and schedule a short phone interview.
At the phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player.
Immediately schedule a second phone screen with the Hiring Manager as soon as possible. If, at this second phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player, then ...
Immediately schedule a full day of onsite interviews to meet with all of the needed interviewers. This will be easy because you already follow this Calendar Cadence, so all required interviewers have scheduled to be at the office (or available remotely) on recruiting day, ready to interview. (Using this method, you can easily have several candidates for onsite interviews on the same day.) At the end of that day, the interview team convenes and makes a decision. 
(Some people question whether one round of interviews is enough to make a good decision. The answer is yes because the real information comes from the Reference Interviews that follow. Google has found that more interviews do not lead to better decisions. In fact, they limit interviews to 5 total of 30 minutes each! They have found that the marginal benefit of more or more extended interviews is close to zero.)
If ""yes,"" reach out to the candidate that evening and say: ""We love you. We want you to work at our company. We want to make you an offer pending reference interviews.""
Have a verbal discussion about what a successful offer would look like. Ask the candidate to complete this phrase: ""I would join your company as long as _________.""
Address each request. If all are doable, move to the next stage.
Conduct the reference interviews. Do not skip or skimp on this stage. These interviews are the most crucial part of the interview process and give the most accurate information about how a candidate will perform.
If the reference interviews are wildly positive, reach back out to the candidate: ""The reference interviews were great. We'd like for you to join our company. If we make you the following offer (explain every detail of the offer including benefits, etc.), would you accept?"" Go back and forth until you have a verbal agreement.
Invite the candidate for an ""offer ceremony,"" wherein you make them the offer, and they accept. (There is more detail on the offer process below.)
This process can take as little as two weeks from the first contact to the accepted offer. If your process becomes that fast, your acceptance rate from top candidates will start to resemble that of Benchmark and Sequoia.
Then, when your acceptance rate from top candidates begins to soar, become incredibly picky and tighten up your initial selection criteria (from the first 15-minute video call) to choose only the best of the best.
Spouse
While the candidate herself is excited about the idea of working with you, there is another person in the equation who does not get the benefit of being charmed by you and the prospects of the company: the candidate's spouse. They feel fear and have thoughts like
""We have two kids in private school; how can we afford to reduce our current household income by 50%?"" 
""Will this startup ever really pan out, or is it just another flash in the pan like all of those others?""
I find that the biggest blocker to a candidate saying ""Yes"" is their spouse's fear of saying ""No."" The antidote for someone's fear is to make them feel heard. Therefore, I always ask to talk directly to the spouse. I say to the candidate, ""I know that you are excited about this company, but I imagine that your spouse is feeling fear and has many concerns. I'd like for him/her to have those concerns addressed directly and feel that he/she has a direct line of communication with me. Would you be willing to introduce me to him/her so that we can connect directly?""
The answer is usually: ""Let me ask my spouse."" And then, a day later, the connection is made. During the call with the spouse, I simply listen and repeat back the thoughts that I hear. If I can address them, I do. But that is not necessary. Acknowledging the thoughts is really all that is needed. The spouse usually says something like, ""Thank you for doing this. In all of our years together, no boss of my spouse has ever reached out to me like this.""
The candidate usually accepts shortly after that. 
Compensation
How much compensation do you offer new team members? How much cash and equity?
My preferred method is to:
Discover the market compensation for the position (role and seniority). There are plenty of online compensation studies that show this. Market compensation is whatever a big company (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) pays for this position.
Discover the amount of cash that the new team member would need to live comfortably (housing, food, transportation, child expenses, etc.)
It is up to the startup to match the market compensation level, not in cash as the larger companies do, but rather in a much lesser amount of cash (no less than the amount needed to live comfortably), plus equity to bridge the difference. 
Here is an example to show how you calculate the equity portion. Let's say the position is a Level 3 Engineer who is paid $300,000 in total compensation at Google. The team member requires $120,000 in cash to live comfortably and invests the remainder in startup equity. Calculate the amount of equity by taking the difference between market and cash ($300,000-$120,000=$180,000) and multiplying it by four years ($180,000 x 4 = $720,000). This amount is then divided by a factor between 1 and 2, representing a very conservative estimate of the increase in equity value over four years. A 1 represents no expected increase in Value. A 2 represents a 2x expected increase in Value. If 1.5 were used (which is the most common), the final amount would be $720,000 / 1.5 = $480,000. So grant this amount in options; however much equity it purchases at the company's current valuation—the options vest over four years.
Then I prefer to make an offer that allows the new team member to choose how much they want to invest in the startup equity at three different levels. The lowest cash level would be the level needed to live comfortably. 
Here's an example in which the company is currently worth $50mm. The company will likely need another major financing round and optional pool refresh before it reaches maturity, which is an expected 50% dilution to the current cap table. A $1 billion eventual value of the company would result in a 10x increase in the equity value. (20x increase in company value x 50% dilution = 10x increase in equity value.)
The three options would be:


 
Annual Cash
Equity Worth
Expected Value at $1 billion company valuation
1
$120,000
$480,000
$4,800,000
2
$140,000
$426,666
$4,266,666
3
$160,000
$361,333
$3,613,333


The hope is that the new team member believes so fully in the company (and the power of the asymmetric bet) that they choose one of the two higher equity offers. This equity is thus an investment that the team member is making in the company. And with a huge advantage: They make the investment with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power.
Making the Offer
Before making an offer, it is critical to know that the candidate will accept. Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:
""I will join the company as long as ….""
They then should state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.
Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:
""If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?""
If they say yes, then make them an offer. If you skip this step and simply make them the offer, it is very common for them to ask for a few more things after-the-fact (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. It is far better to get the candidate to pre-agree in complete detail before making the offer. Then the relationship begins with a resoundingly positive ""Yes! Thank you! I'm so excited!""
The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. We recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Invite the candidate to receive the offer in person. Create a ritual out of this process. Here are some possibilities:
Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
Give company schwag. 
Give hugs and high-fives. 
Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable.
Onboarding
Most companies spend extraordinary resources of time, money, and equity to bring on a new team member, and then almost entirely drop the ball on quickly getting that team member onboarded and up to speed on how the company works so that they can begin making a full contribution. Don't make this mistake! Give onboarding even more attention, time, and energy than you give to recruiting. After all, many of the people you are spending time with during recruiting will not become team members. Whereas 100% of the people that you spend time with during onboarding are already team members. Focus your energy there!
Write a checklist of all of the information that a team member would need to be fully effective. Write all of this information down and make a video of it. Share this checklist, the written/video info, and the 90-day roadmap with each new team member as early as you can, even before they start.
On their first day at the office, have them come in two hours after the normal start of the day so that there are plenty of people there to greet the new team member. Assign each new team member a buddy with whom they'll check in each day for fifteen minutes for the first two weeks. These fifteen minutes are for the new team member to ask questions that arise and for the buddy to ensure that the new team member is going through the checklist.
Todd McKinnon of Okta takes it a step further, which I recommend that you do as well: ""My best tip when onboarding a new direct report. Meet with them for 1 hour daily for the first month. Simple but effective.""

Recruiting at ___ (30 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw1bOV14woAMGV7x_RI_yjWSuUa1aDDfDgL2M8Vg7sA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Recruiting at _____
Mission
To hire only A players. 
These are the right superstars who can do the job we need done while fitting in with the culture of _____.
Methodology
Scorecard. The Hiring Manager creates a document in Drive that describes precisely what he/she wants the person to accomplish in the role. This is a set of outcomes and competencies that define a job. They must be both measurable and have an accomplish-by date.
Source. All Hiring Managers systematically source before we have slots to fill. 
Select. We conduct structured interviews that rate candidates against the scorecard that we've created.
Sell. Finally, we persuade the best candidates to join our team.
Scorecard
Mission
What is the mission for the position?
The Mission describes the business problem and its solution. 
Example: ""The Operations Lead will create and manage a world-class department that will support every _____er by providing the environment, information, tools, training, and habits they need to succeed in their role and make _____ a massive success."" 
Outcomes
What are the outcomes that must be accomplished, by when? 
This is what the person must get done. These outcomes should be measurable, have a due date, and there should be 3 to 8 of them (target is 5) ranked by order of importance. 
Example: ""Turn every _____er into a ninja user of our internal tools (Asana, RelateIQ, GoogleApps) and methodologies (GTD, Inbox Zero, Management by Objectives, Active Listening) by Oct 31, 2014.""
 
What traits/habits do we require to:
1) succeed in the role?
2) fit in at _____? 
This is how the person must do it. These are the behaviors that someone must exhibit to achieve the outcomes above.
Examples
Interesting and Interested. Is interested in getting to know the stories of others. They have interesting stories. We genuinely want to hang out with them. 
Organized. Personally organized. Follows the GTD method or something like it, and therefore stays well aware of all to-dos and events. Focuses on key priorities.

Collaborative. Reaches out to peers and cooperates with managers to establish an overall collaborative environment.
Persuasive. Able to convince others to pursue a course of action.
Coachable. Wants to improve; open to feedback; act on that feedback
Alignment
We pressure-test the scorecard by comparing it with the Company and Department Roadmaps and the scorecards of others that the person will interface with. We ensure that there is alignment and then share the scorecard with relevant _____ers, including peers and recruiters.
A good scorecard process translates the strategy's objectives into clear outcomes for the Exec Team, translating their results into clear outcomes for those who report to them, etc. Every _____er ends up with a set of results that support the strategy and competencies that support the outcomes and culture. First, we look for the ability to do the job that is needed today. Second, we look for flexibility and adaptability for what the role may become tomorrow.
 
Source
We are constantly sourcing, identifying the who before a new hire is really needed.
There are three sources of candidates:
1. Referrals from our network.
2. Recruiters
3. Researchers 
Referrals. Of these three, referrals from our personal and professional networks are by far the most effective.
                We need to ask ourselves:  “Who are the most talented people I know that _____ should hire?”  And then ask all the talented people in our network, and every talented person that we meet “Who are the most talented people that you know that _____ should hire?”  Ask our advisors, customers, partners, suppliers.  Join a professional organization.  Ask there.


                Please fill out your Top 20 candidates.
An objective that will go on each of our scorecards is: ""Source one candidate who passes the _____ phone screen per quarter.""
Recruiters.  We occasionally use recruiters. They are not as effective as our own network.  And we understand that to be effective at all, they need to know and understand _____.  It is pointless to engage recruiters unless we bring them inside the kimono and fully expose them to _____.  We do so by sharing the scorecard with them, as well as every detail of our reaction to candidates they propose.  
Researchers.  These are people who research networks and generate names, but do not reach out directly to candidates.  We rarely use researchers.
 
Here is our Process for Sourcing:

Gamify the process. Give a prize to whoever reaches out to the most people (or whatever other metric you want to use).
Deputizing friends of _____. We offer a referral bonus of $______ and regularly ask friends of _____ for referrals.
Hiring recruiters. When we hire recruiters, we give them full access to our scorecards and our reaction to candidates.
ATS (Applicant Tracking System). We are relentless about entering all relevant information into our ATS. This system is everyone's responsibility. While one owner of this list will check it weekly for ""not filled out the information,"" we will pester each other to enter this information whenever we see holes. 
Select
We have a set of four interviews that allow us to rate a person against our scorecard. To be great interviewers, we must get out of the habit of passively witnessing how somebody acts during an interview. And instead, use the four interviews to collect facts and data about how they have performed over decades.
Screening Interview
Topgrading Interview
Focused Interview
Reference Interview
Phone Screen Interview
The goal is to eliminate people who are inappropriate for the position as soon as possible. One can conduct this by phone, and it should not last more than 30 minutes. Preview that it will last 15 minutes, then extend to 30 during the call only if the candidate appears to be excellent.
The Hiring Manager will assign the first screener. If the candidate passes the first screen, the Hiring Manager will do the second screen.
Read the scorecard just before the call.
Set expectations:
""Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I'd like to spend the first 10 minutes of our call getting to know you. After that, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about us. Sound good?""
(It is essential to get their information first so that what you get isn't simply a parroting back of what _____ is looking for.)
The script:
1. ""What are your career goals?""
(If his/her goals sound like an echo of the _____ website or they don't have any, screen them out.)
2. ""What are you good at professionally?""
(Push them to give you 8-12 positives, with examples, so that you can build a complete picture of their capabilities. You are listening for strengths that match the scorecard.)
3. ""What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?""
(Push them for real weaknesses, 5-8 of them. If they don't respond thoroughly enough, call them on it. If they still don't, then say the following: ""If you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up reference calls with your bosses, peers, and subordinates. What do you think they will say are some things that you are not good at, or not interested in?"")
4. ""Who were your last three bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 0-10 scale when we talk to them?""
(Press for details of why each person would give them such a rating. We are looking for consistent 8-10s. A 6 is actually a 2. But ask why it's a 6.)
1. What are your career goals?
2. What are you good at professionally?
3. What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?
4. Who were your last three bosses, and how will they rate your performance on a 0-10 scale when talking to them?
And then, it is essential to go deeper. Throughout the interview, get curious. Ask follow-up questions that start with ""What,"" ""How,"" or ""Tell me more.""
Examples:
• ""What do you mean?""
• ""What is an example of that?""
• ""How did you do that?""
• ""How did that feel?""
(Developer hires will have an extra screening step of performing a programming test.) 
The goal of this phone screen is to weed out candidates quickly. If you can't definitively say: ""This is an A candidate,"" then hit the gong. It is better for us to miss out on an A player than to waste many precious hours on a borderline case that turns out to be a B or C player. If we weed harshly, we will spend more time with candidates who are known A players.
If you think this is an A player, let the candidate know that you believe they are great and that you are open to extending this phone interview to get to know them more and answer their questions about _____. Jump into ""selling"" mode.

If you think that the candidate is not an A player, end the call at the scheduled time (15 minutes, hopefully). Within 24 hours, inform them that you appreciated their time, but you will not be moving forward with them at this time. ""Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. We do not feel that our needs for this role match your strengths. That being said, we will be hiring for many more roles in the future, and we hope to be able to reach back out to you again.""
While it may feel difficult to say ""no"" to people, it is disrespectful to let them linger. The vast majority of people prefer a quick ""no"" to a slow one, or worse yet, no response at all.
Now, let's get back to that candidate who is an A.
Selling
In addition to getting curious about a candidate's passions, dreams, and personal life (as described in Building Trust and Like), the key to successfully selling a candidate on ____ is giving them enough information so that they will see that at _____ they will have: 
Fit, Family, Freedom, Fun.
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap, and their Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going.
Family. ""What can we do to make this change as easy as possible for your family?"" Ask about their family. Get to know their names, ages, etc. Ask what concerns and needs their family members have. Meet those needs. Ideally, meet their family in person (or at a minimum, speak to their spouse on the phone), discover their needs directly, and meet those needs.
Freedom. ""At ____, we collaboratively set Company, Department and Individual OKRs at the beginning of each quarter. Your Individual OKRs means that I will not micromanage you. In our regular 1-1s, I will ask you to update me on your progress toward your OKRs, and offer you support whenever you run into obstacles. I encourage you to talk to my team to see what I am like to work with.""
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____.
At the end of the phone interview, let the candidate know that you would like to immediately schedule the next interview (either the second phone interview or the on-site interviews).
On-Site Interviews
For the on-site interviews, schedule interviews back-to-back (with some break time in between) with all of the needed decision-makers, followed by a decision meeting at the end of the day attended by all interviewers. The goal is to get all required buy-in for a yes/no decision in one day of interviews. 
This day of interviews will include:
A Topgrading interview
Several Focused interviews
The schedule for the interviewers will look something like this:
830-900am Interviewers meeting. Here's what's going to happen today. Review scorecard, candidate's resume, notes from screening interviews, and roles/responsibilities for the day.
845-900am A team member greets the candidate and orients them to the day ahead.
900-1100am Topgrading Interview. (1-2 hours)
1100-noon Focused Interview.
Noon-100pm Lunch with _____.
100-400pm Focused Interviews
400-415pm Host thanks the candidate and explains the next steps.
415-500pm Decision Meeting. The interview team meets to rate the scorecard. Hiring Manager makes a YES/NO decision to conduct reference calls or terminate the process.
Topgrading Interview
The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's story and patterns. These stories and practices are predictive of the candidate's future performance. Start from the beginning and move forward chronologically. Create chapters of a job (or groups of jobs) that last 3-5 years. This interview should take about 2 hours (3 hours for a CEO, 1 hour for entry-level). It is worth the time. For every hour we spend Topgrading a candidate, we'll save 100s of hours not dealing with B or C players.
The Hiring Manager should conduct the Topgrading Interview and a colleague who wants to learn the method by observing.
In the interview, first set expectations:
""Thank you for visiting us today. We are going to do a chronological interview and walk through each job you've had. For each job, I am going to ask you five core questions.
What were you hired to do? 
What accomplishments are you most proud of? 
What were some low points during that job? 
Who were the people you worked with? 
Why did you leave that job?
At the end of the interview, we will discuss your career goals and aspirations, and you can ask me questions about us. 

80 percent of the process will take place in this room, but if we mutually decide to move forward, we will conduct reference calls to complete the process.
Finally, while this sounds lengthy, it will go remarkably fast. It is my job to guide the pace of the discussion. Sometimes I will ask you to go into more depth; other times, I will ask that we move on to the next topic. I'll try to make sure that we leave plenty of time to cover your most recent and, therefore, most relevant jobs.
Any questions before we begin?""
The script:
For each job or group of jobs (lasting 3-5 years).
1. What were you hired to do?
You are trying to create a picture of their scorecard as if they had one. What were their mission and key outcomes (or Objectives and Key Results)?
2. What accomplishments are you most proud of?
Hopefully, these accomplishments will match the outcomes described in the first question.
3. What were some low points during that job?
Do not let the candidate off the hook. Reframe the question over and over again until you get honest answers.
4. Who were the people you worked with? Specifically:
i. What was your boss' name, and how do you spell that? What was it like working with him/her? What will he/she tell me were your biggest strengths and areas for improvement?
Follow the script exactly. By letting the candidate know that we will be contacting these references, the candidate will become much more truthful. This is the most crucial question we ask during the Topgrading Interview, as it gives us the information needed to do the Reference Interviews. For the most recent or significant job, also ask:
ii. Who were your peers on the team, and how do you spell their names? 
iii. Who were the members of your team, and how do you spell their names?
Again, these are critical questions that will enable the Reference Interviews. 

iv. How would you rate the team you inherited on an A, B, and C scale? What changes did you make? Did you hire anybody? Fire anybody? How would you rate the team when you left it on an A, B, and C scale?
Does the candidate accept the hand they have been dealt, or do they make changes to get a better hand? You can also use the reference check method to get more information: ""When we speak with members of your team, what will they say are your biggest strengths and weaknesses as a manager?""
5. Why did you leave that job?
Was the candidate promoted, recruited, or fired? Get very curious about why?
To conduct this interview well, you will have to:
1. Interrupt. Do so tactfully. But do not let a candidate ramble. Doing so will only hurt their chances of success because it will chew up valuable time without conveying important information. Expect to interrupt the candidate once every 3-4 minutes. 
The proper way to interrupt someone is to be positive and use reflective listening: ""Wow! It sounds like that pig farm next to the corporate office smelled horrible!"" The candidate says: ""Yes."" Then you immediately say:"" You were telling me earlier about launching that email campaign. I'd love to hear what that was like? How well did it go?""
2. Three Ps. Use the 3 Ps to clarify how valuable an accomplishment was in context.
i. How did your performance compare to the previous year's performance?
ii. How did your performance compare to the plan?
iii. How did your performance compare to that of your peers?
3. Push versus Pull. People who perform well are generally pulled to more significant opportunities.
For each job change, determine if it was a push or a pull.
Push. ""It was mutual."" ""It was time for me to leave.""
Pull. ""My biggest client hired me."" ""My old boss recruited me to a bigger job.""
4. Painting a Picture. You'll know that you understand what a candidate is saying when you can see a picture of it in your mind. Put yourself in their shoes.

5. Stopping at the Stop Signs. If you see or hear inconsistencies, the candidate may be telling an untruth. If this happens, get curious, and dig deeper. Think of yourself as a biographer (positive), not an investigative journalist (negative).
Focused Interview
Three _____ers (not the Hiring Manager) will be asked to conduct 3 Focused Interviews, each 50 minutes. The focused interview is a chance to involve other team members and get more specific information about the candidate. Focus the interview on the outcomes (skills) and competencies (culture fit) of the scorecard. Get curious after every answer by using the ""What? How? Tell me more"" framework. We split the Outcomes and Competencies in the scorecard into three sections, allowing each interviewer to focus on one area (⅓ of the Outcomes and ⅓ of the Competencies).
Set the stage:
1. ""The purpose of this interview is to talk about ____________(fill in the blank with the Outcomes and Competencies in the Scorecard that you are going to review).""
The script:
1. ""Now we are going to talk about ___________ (fill in the blank with the next Outcome or Competency to be reviewed). 
2. What are your most significant accomplishments in this area during your career?
3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?""
The rating:
At the end of the day of on-site interviews, we hold a Decision Meeting. The entire interview team gathers. All submit their comments on the candidate in writing in the ATS system. We then declare our positions on each candidate.
Skill-Will Bull's Eye. We only choose candidates whose skill (what they can do) and will (what they want to do) matches our scorecard. This scorecard is their skill-will profile. For each item on the scorecard, rate the candidate's skill-will. Only rate people an A in whom you have a greater than 90% confidence that they can and will meet all outcomes and competencies.
Red Flags:
Here are the things to watch out for during the interview process that signal problems:
- Candidate does not mention past failures.
- Candidate exaggerates his or her answers.
- Candidate takes credit for the work of others.
- Candidate speaks poorly of past bosses.
- Candidate cannot explain job moves.
- Their family doesn't want them to take this job.
- For managerial hires, the candidate has never had to hire or fire anybody.
- Candidate is more interested in compensation and title than in the job itself and _____.
- Candidate tries too hard to look like an expert.
- Candidate is not curious about us or others. (Candidate is self-absorbed.)
The selection:
1. Update all the Scorecards.
2. Rate each candidate.
3. If we have no A's, restart the process to step 2: Source.
4. If we have one A, we make them an offer pending reference interviews.
5. If we have several A's, we rank them and offer pending reference interviews to the best A from among them. We try to find another role at _____ for the other A's.
Reference Interview
We do not skip the reference checks! The Reference Interviews are where we learn the truth about the candidate. These interviews give us by far the most accurate picture of the candidate's future performance.
1. We pick the proper references. Bosses, peers, and subordinates (sometimes 2-3 levels down). We do not use the reference list that the candidate gives us.
2. We ask the candidate to contact the references and set up the calls.
3. The Hiring Manager conducts at least 2 (but preferably 4) reference interviews, and other team members do at least 1 (but preferably 3) more for a total of at least 3 (but preferably 7).
The script:
1. ""In what context did you work with the person?""

2. ""What were the person's biggest strengths?""
Get curious by using the ""What? How? Tell me more"" framework.

3. ""What were the person's biggest areas for improvement back then?""
It is essential to say ""back then."" This expression liberates people to talk about fundamental weaknesses, assuming that the candidate has improved them by now. (In reality, past performance is an indicator of future performance.)

4. ""How would you rate his/her overall performance in that job on a scale of 0-10? What about his/her performance causes you to give that rating?""

5. ""The person mentioned that he/she struggled with ________ in that job. Can you please tell me more about that?""
People do not like to give negative references, so listen for cues. Faint or qualified praise is damning, as is hesitation.
From Danny An, Founder of TrustToken: 
“When asking for weaknesses or areas of improvement during interviews and reference calls, people answer more freely if you say, ""People shouldn't do the majority of things and should focus on areas where they can use their strengths. Understanding weaknesses demonstrates self-awareness."" 
Sell
Our decision to hire the candidate is only one part of the equation. The second and even more critical part is selling the candidate to join us. 
As described in Building Trust and Like, the key is to put yourself in the candidate's shoes. Find out what they care about. And then care about it yourself. Most people tend to care about …
Fit. Share the Company Roadmap, Department Roadmap, and their Individual Roadmap. Show how where they want to go is a match for where _____ is going.
Family. ""What can we do to make this change as easy as possible for your family?"" Ask about their family. Get to know their names, ages, etc. Ask what concerns and needs they have. Meet those needs. (Ideally, meet their family in person, discover their needs directly, and meet those needs.)
Freedom. ""The Individual Roadmap allows you the freedom to make decisions. I will not micromanage you."" Encourage the candidate to do reference checks on you to see what you are like to work with.
Fun. Here is what we do for fun at _____.
Fortune. ""If you accomplish your objectives, and we as a company accomplish ours, you will likely make x over the next 5-10 years.""
Selling happens throughout the recruiting process. Here are key moments to put yourself in a candidates shoes and address the issues above:
1. When you source
2. When you interview
3. The time between your verbal offer and the candidate's acceptance (reach out to them repeatedly during this time!)
4. The time between the candidate's acceptance and his/her first day (yes, they still aren't really here yet; keep reaching out to them!)
5. The new hire's first 100 days on the job (yes, they are still evaluating; keep addressing what they care about!) Be persistent. Think lots of touches! Too many candidates are lost because they feel abandoned once they are offered or arrive at the company.
Implementation
To implement this recruiting system:
1. Announce it to the company.
2. Train all Hiring Managers and interviewers.
3. Implement the schedule and process. Enter the process and questions in the ATS system.
4. Put ""Source 1 great candidate"" on everyone's quarterly scorecard (i.e., OKRs)
Legal
Don't discriminate. We hire people on one criteria only: whether they are likely to perform the job or not. Keep in mind the following:
1. Relevance. Defining the outcomes and competencies will ensure that we are judging on relevant criteria.
2. Standardization. Having a standard process ensures fairness across all groups.
3. Non-discriminatory language. We always use ""he/she"" or ""they."" No derogatory language toward anyone, ever.
4. No illegal questions: Anything related to marital status, intention to have children, pregnancy, date or place of birth, medical condition, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical or mental handicaps.

Making the Offer (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDbshCFwd19_6Ke__-0klE-BYJdJympMMprybTIp1bg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"Making the Offer (1 min)


If you make a written offer to a candidate that you love, hoping that they will accept, they may well do so. But they will also be tempted to ask for a few more things before accepting (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. 
To keep the offer and acceptance process entirely positive, do the following:
Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:
""I will join the company as long as ….""
They will (hopefully) state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.
Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:
""If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?""
If they say yes, then invite them in to make the offer in person. The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. I recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Here are some possibilities:
Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
Give company swag. 
Give hugs and high-fives. 
Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable. If you do this, the relationship will begin with a resoundingly positive ""Yes! Thank you! I'm so excited!""

Note: Senior execs will always require that their attorney review the offer before they accept. That is fine. In advance of making the offer, you can share the language of the contract and all the details except for the compensation (income and equity).
"
Compensation (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnMXBO0uum5E5x6QlMcbcdOIRightwdy73DzRerKTdI/edit# ,"Compensation (3 min)
How much compensation do you offer new team members? How much cash and equity?
My preferred method is to:
Discover the market compensation for the position (role and seniority). There are plenty of online compensation studies that show this. Market compensation is whatever a big company (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) pays for this position.


Discover the amount of cash that the new team member would need to live comfortably (housing, food, transportation, child expenses, etc.).
It is up to the startup to match the market compensation level, not in cash as the larger companies do, but rather in a much lesser amount of cash (no less than the amount needed to live comfortably), plus equity to bridge the difference. 
Here is an example to show how to calculate the equity portion. Let's say the position is a Level 3 Engineer who is paid $300,000 in total compensation at Google. The team member requires $120,000 in cash to live comfortably and invests the remainder in startup equity. To calculate the amount of equity take the difference between market and cash ($300,000-$120,000=$180,000) and multiplying it by four years ($180,000 x 4 = $720,000). Then divide this amount by a factor somewhere between 1 and 2, which represents a very conservative estimate of the increase in value of the equity over four years. A 1 represents no expected increase in value. A 2 represents a 2x expected increase in value. If 1.5 were used (which is the most common factor used), the final amount would be $720,000 / 1.5 = $480,000. So grant this amount in options; however much equity it purchases at the company's current valuation—the options vest over four years.
I prefer to make an offer that allows the new team member to choose how much they want to invest in the startup equity at three different levels. The lowest cash level would be the level needed to live comfortably. 
Here's an example in which the company is currently worth $50mm. The company will likely need to do another major financing round, and optional pool refreshes before it reaches maturity, an expected 50% dilution to the current cap table. A $1 billion eventual value of the company would result in a 10x increase in the equity value. (20x increase in company value x 50% dilution = 10x increase in equity value.)
The three options would be:

 
Annual Cash
Equity Worth
Expected Value at $1 billion company valuation

The hope is that the new team member believes so fully in the company (and the power of the asymmetric bet) that they choose one of the two higher equity offers. This equity is thus an investment that the team member is making in the company. And with a huge advantage: The employee makes the investment with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power.

Hiring Execs: External vs Internal (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaknANyT2UJC0YMF6zYnErMp4imlslDbPmg-d9yeGlI/edit ,"Hiring Execs: External vs Internal (2 min)
As a company hits PMF (Product Market Fit) and begins to scale quickly, there is tremendous pressure to hire ""real execs"" to run each major department. By now, the dangers of hiring overqualified people into these roles are well-documented. The conventional wisdom is that you want to hire people who match the role's requirements for the next 12-18 months, not the period beyond that, as suggested by Elad Gil. But I want to introduce a far-more-radical and far-less-popular view:
Hiring externally is a failure of training! Executives are nothing more than managers of managers. And there is only one set of training that every manager needs to become an exec: How to manage well. In addition, there is a massive benefit from providing this training internally: all of your execs and managers will use a similar management system, and therefore the company as a whole will operate as one unified team, rather than disparate teams tied together by a company name only. See Scaling: Hire a ""Manager Trainer"" as COO
Certain areas require functional expertise: Legal, Engineering, Finance/Accounting. But do not be fooled that when you hire an experienced lawyer as your General Counsel, a skilled engineer as your VP Engineering, and an experienced accountant or investment banker as your CFO, that you are also hiring an excellent manager. It is a rare case when you are doing so. 
In addition, existing team members are entirely known quantities. You see if they exhibit the behaviors you want (culture), whether they understand the details of your business, and whether you plain like them. External hires are rarely a perfect culture match, often take months if not years to truly understand your business, and if you end up not liking them personally you will not spend the necessary time with them to fully train them on how you want them to operate. 
I coach many highly successful late-stage companies. When I ask the CEOs who their top exec team members are, the names that I hear are often promoted internally. 
So, before you hire external executives, build a manager training program. If you have to hire externally for a person to run this program, so be it. Give them the title COO. Make it clear that their primary job function is to train all of the company's managers.
This function was Sheryl Sandberg's gift to Facebook. You deserve the same.

Onboarding a new hire (2 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwrvtGTdhCbxparQ3a4y7Z5RidSHXzsZORoGTubcY3U/edit ,"Onboarding a new hire (3 min)

Video of Matt talking to Ryan Caldbeck (senior exec) about his reaction to shadowing (2 min)

Every position you hire for is already being done by someone in the company right now. The current work will be stretching someone doing it, they may not be performing as well as you want them to, but they are doing it.

Any new hire does not know your company, how you do things or the team dynamics. If you ask the new hire to start the position on Day 1 without context, there is a high probability that they will fail.

Fear not; there is an easy solution.  

For the first 30 days (even better is 60), ask them to shadow the person who is currently doing the job (observing all 1-1s, team meetings, and external meetings). 

After 30 days (or 60), the new hire can then take over. They will now have the full context of what you were doing before and will retain valuable history. They will have strong opinions about improving things, but they will also know what valuable pieces to preserve. They are now highly likely to succeed. 

When they do take over, it is critical that you also shadow them for 2-4 weeks (or as long as you can stand it, because frankly this reverse shadowing will likely be quite boring and painful for you), and give them feedback after each meeting until you realize that they are performing better in the role than you were!!

When reverse-shadowing, it  is key to withhold your feedback until after the meeting so that you don’t interrupt the new hire’s flow.  If you have the discipline to watch a recorded meeting, then an easy way to ensure that you only give feedback after the meeting is to video record the meeting, watch the recording (at 1.5x speed), and then give feedback.  Personally, I do not have this discipline, so I therefore observe the live meeting and simply write down my feedback and share it immediately afterwards.

This technique can be generalized for all Teaching / Training.


Another way of saying this same thing…
To learn about the onboarding process from a Chief of Staff’s point of view, please read: Onboard yourself in 30 days, by Regina Gerbeaux

Everyone I coach, I recommend getting a Chief of Staff (2 min), and almost all have. These Chiefs of Staff are usually young (<30) and therefore relatively inexperienced. They gain the trust of the CEO, perform well, and most end up running entire departments within the company. The success rate among them is close to 100%. 

My coachees also hire new executives. These folks are usually much more experienced, and on paper, much more impressive. Logic dictates that their success rate should be higher than those of the CoS role. Instead, their success rate is about 50%. 

Why is this? I have concluded that it is all about onboarding. We allow the CoS to shadow the CEO for months (gaining full context) before asking them to perform. On the other hand, the executives are usually air-dropped into a live fire (without context) and asked to perform Day 1. 

I ask my CEOs, “If you could wait 30-60 days and bring your new executive success rate from 50% to 100%, would you?” They, of course, all answer, “Yes.” So, we are now implementing the above onboarding methodology.  

This just started in April of 2021. I will update you on the results over the coming months and years. I am enormously optimistic.  

It is November 2021.  The results are starting to come in.  They are all excellent.  BioRender, Vendr, Viz, Belong, Sonder, Vendr have all done this with great success.  More coming soon.  





Feedback

From Regina Gerbeaux, my former Chief of Staff:

Shadowing somewhat resonates with me as someone who went through this process with Matt. I think it was tremendously helpful to onboard by shadowing Matt’s every move. (Things rarely set in for me when I passively observe.) For someone like me, though, I know I learn better by doing versus watching.

Therefore, I think this format (observing for 30-60-90 days) works very specific to how a company functions, but less so for mundane tasks like ordering things, scheduling internal meetings, etc., where the stakes are less high (aka Type 2 tasks or decisions.) I feel most free and like I learned the most when performing the task versus watching, especially when I already know how to do it.

TL;DR:
Shadow for 30 days? YES.  
Observe company-specific things to gain context? YES.  
Observe even mundane, small tasks? NO. Do those myself instead.

From Trishia Pasaquian, my EA:

Yes, it resonates with me. Based on my experience as a new hire, shadowing is the most effective way to learn and gain context of what the company is about, what they do, and how they do it. I’m not sure about the 60 days, but 30 is good. After 30 days, Loom recordings, Notion write-ups, or Tango will do, primarily if some tasks can be taught/discussed during coworking times.

From Sydney Liu, CEO of Commaful:


When we were hiring for our Chief of Staff role, we did paid shadowing as the final step. The final candidates shadowed me for a day and shared their notes about what they observed, learned, found exciting, and what could be improved.


This was a great way to get a feel for what it was like to work with the person while also seeing what they absorbed, how they processed information, what they could do on the job, and how organized they were all in several action-packed hours. We were able to make an informed hire for this role based on this portion of the interview.

To perform a job well, a person needs to have: 
the skills to do so
the organization to follow through
the behaviors that match the company's values
You can teach all of these. 
Therefore, failure to perform is most often a failure of training or hiring.
The best way that I know of to teach (or train) is:
You watch me perform the role several times. You document the process that you see me going through.  Feel free to ask questions. Once I think that you understand what I am doing …


I watch you perform the role. I will give you regular feedback. Once I see that you are performing the role well …


You train your backup to do it. This training is what actually solidifies the learning for you, as it forces you to understand what you are doing to explain it to another.
If you are training a manager or new hire, this looks like:
You watch me run all of the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.
You write down my process for running the 1-1s and team meetings.
I watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks and give you feedback.
You invite your #2 to watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.

Firing Well (updated) (5 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit ,"Firing Well (updated)

When you do fire someone, put yourself in their shoes. It is a devastating event emotionally. And it is a real setback financially. Your team will also be watching closely to see how you treat ex-employees: a vindictive attitude will make everyone feel unsafe!
Put real effort into helping the person find their next job, and quickly. Give them a severance package that gives them enough time to find another job and have the pay begin realistically. This package is two months minimum, but more realistically, three months or more. And then help them find work within that time frame.
Because you value transparency, make an announcement to the company about the person's departure, or allow the person to do it themselves. When you make the announcement, DO NOT blame or criticize the person. Instead, praise the person's contributions to the company, and take ownership yourself for the fact that you weren't able to match their skills to the company's needs. Either you didn't evaluate well during the recruiting process, or you didn't onboard and train well. Take responsibility for the situation, and explain what you are doing to ensure it doesn't happen again.
It is highly likely that you will be feeling anger toward this person. 
You value the rest of your team much more highly than this person. You will not want to give the person an extra penny. You will want to save those resources for the team that remains that is performing. 
You likely also think, ""This person is a liability. I don't ever want to be associated with this person, and I wouldn't want them associated with my name ever again.""
Feel this anger, and then let it pass. 
Recognize that you have a responsibility here. Your recruiting, training and management helped create this situation. It is your responsibility to help the person find a job and a better fit company. If you want to save your company's resources, then help them find that job more quickly. And then turn to your recruiting, training, and managing processes, and ask yourself: ""What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""
Recognize that this person did not have the skills or behaviors you needed, but they have passions. Find out what those passions are. Behind those passions are likely excellent skills. Help the person determine what role (it may not be in the business world) would be a great fit for them. What would their dream job be? Then become their agent, and help them land that dream job. Do exactly what an agent does:
Interview them to discover what their ideal role is. Match that ideal against your knowledge of their skills/passions to actual roles available to determine a real job that they would enjoy and be good at.

Create a written description of the person and their talents. If OKed by the person, post it on your social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) with your written endorsement of the candidate. Ask interested employers to contact the person directly. 
Offer to send a message of recommendation if the candidate gets past a first-round interview at a company. Use LinkedIn to discover who you know at that company.
I have found that the message of endorsement works one time and usually moves the candidate to the next stage. You can either use the bullet to get the candidate an interview or use it after the first interview to land them the job itself. The latter is much more valuable.
If you do this, not only will you be doing the right thing and taking responsibility for your actions, but you will also create a culture of safety in your company. 
It will put your remaining team at ease (allowing them to perform better at their job), and news of this culture will spread quickly so that soon your Glassdoor reviews will rise. This action, in turn, will make your company a far more desirable place to work, and your rate of offer acceptance will go up dramatically.


It will ease pressure during the recruiting process. If you and your team know that you have a humane approach to letting people go, you can take a bit more risk on people with great potential but little experience during the recruiting process. And those often end up being the best performers.


It will allow you to let underperformers go sooner because you won't dread the trauma of the firing process. There will be no trauma. 


You may even go to the Jack Welch model outlined here: Comms, Internal: Announcing traumatic events
Yes, doing the right thing often pays for itself several times over!
I call the process above ""Firing Well."" If you learn how to do it, you benefit from a happier culture, a bolder hiring process, and a much more effective performance management system. All of these will strengthen your team and your company.

How to announce to the person?
First, read Difficult Conversations:  how to have them (1 min).

Here is what I did to create this situation
I am going to help you in the following ways 
I will be your agent in finding your next job
I am giving you ___ months severance, which they will receive upon …
Transferring key information back to the company
Signing your offboarding documents
Today is your last day (unless more time is required to transfer key information)
The reason for this is that it minimizes the time that everyone lingers in the sadness of saying goodbye.  
The remainder of today is hopefully enough time to say goodbye.
After hearing this, I imagine that you are feeling anger, fear and sadness.  Would you be willing to share your thoughts with me?
(Repeat back what they share with you.  This helps reduce their anger from dangerous levels.)
How to announce to the company?
Any change in the organizational structure, be it terminations or reporting changes, causes trauma to the organization. And anytime there is the potential for trauma, it is essential to:
Be transparent with the entire organization


Give each person a chance to release their fear or anger
To do this:
Announce the org change in the group meeting (usually All Hands)
Schedule 1-1s for each person shortly after the group meeting. These can be the regularly-scheduled 1-1s that each manager has with their reports.


Have each manager directly ask each report in the 1-1 if they feel fear or anger about the org change. If they are, allow them to fully release their thoughts and feelings.  See Heard: how to make people feel it (2 min) for how to do this.

“I have decided to hire a CRO and layer my VP of Sales.  Now I need to tell my VP of Sales.  He will likely be devastated.  But I want him to stay, as he does a fine job on the sales side, just not on the marketing side.  How do I deliver the message without causing him to leave?”

There will always come a moment when you have to deliver news that the recipient will not like.  It will be a difficult conversation.  Here’s how to have it …

First, prepare by reading the Giving Feedback section in Feedback.  

Second, ask if the person is available to talk.

“I’d like to talk to you Sam.  Is now a good time?”    If not, ask “When would be a good time?”
This conversation should happen synchronously (in person, or on a video or audio call), not asynchronously.   It’s important to see or hear the person’s emotional reaction to your message. 

Third, when you begin the meeting, start by letting the person know that this will be a difficult conversation.

“This is going to be a difficult conversation.  You are likely going to feel some combination of anger, fear and sadness.”

Why?  Because the times when we go into deepest fear and anger are when we are surprised.  But if we get a warning that something negative is about to occur, we can mentally prepare just a little bit, and then the surprise and the feelings of fear and anger are not nearly as large.

Fourth, clearly state the difficult thing.


“I am going to hire a CRO and will ask you to report to them.”

Do not lead up to this.  Get the punchline out first so that the person knows that this decision has already been made, and does not try to lobby you.  This is … ripping the band-aid off in one stroke.

Fifth, briefly explain why.

“I am doing this because our customers need … “

This should not be a long explanation.  Just 2-3 bullet points.  At this point, the person listening has likely gone into some version of fear, anger or sadness.  Their brain is not fully functioning, so they have a limited capacity to hear and process.  Therefore, keep it short.

Sixth, ask them for their thoughts and feelings.  

“I imagine that you are likely feeling anger, fear or sadness.  I’d like to know your feelings and thoughts.  Are you open to sharing them with me?”

The person will likely have lots of feelings and thoughts.  Stating those thoughts will allow the person to release them just a bit. 

Seventh, whatever they say, make them feel Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).

“I think I heard you say ….  Am I close?”

You do not need to act on their thoughts, just let them know that you understand their thoughts.  That’s all.  This will allow the person to let go of some of their harsher feelings.  Not entirely.  But enough that they likely won’t act rashly.  



Eighth, if you are able to help the person achieve what they truly want (ie- find another great job, etc), do so.

That’s it.

Decision-making: separate decision from implementation (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VkFRbhDTeU0nBEiot8CXiK37UUEZp0D-sT4-IN02Hs/edit ,"Decision-making:  separate decision from implementation (1 min)
(Wei Deng of Clipboard Health shared this rubrik with me.  It’s excellent.)

When we have a difficult decision to make, we often feel lost and confused.  As we imagine the possible answers, none “feel good”.  We can solicit feedback and opinions from others (and this can identify many different possible answers), but we still may not “know” what to do.

In this situation, we are often co-mingling the decision and the implementation.  The decision itself is often clear, but the implementation likely feels painful.  When we think of both together, our feeling of fear about the implementation infects our view of the decision.

To separate the two:


Answer “Who do we serve primarily?”


If you are involved in a company, this is your customer.
If you are involved in a fund, this is both the CEOs that you invest in and the LPs that invest in you.
If you are involved in government, this is the citizens you serve.
If you are involved in a family, this is the members of your family (including you).


Then ask yourself “What is in the best interest of the person we serve primarily?” 


This answer is the correct decision. Write it down.


Now think of the implementation.  It will likely be difficult and painful to implement as you will perceive that it causes injury to others and yourself.  You have two possible routes.


Simply implement without worrying about the injury that it causes, or


Look at the injury that it causes to you and others.


Reach out to those other people and discover what really matters to them.  Then think of ways to help them achieve that. 


With a thought partner, or on your own, think of what really matters to you.  Think of ways to achieve that.


… now implement.

If this process makes sense logically, but you are finding it difficult to follow in practice, ask a co-worker, spouse or friend to be your thought partner.  Share this doc with them.  They will likely be able to walk you through the process successfully.  

Why?  Because they are not in fear about the pain of implementation.  Only you are.

"Comms, Internal:  Announcing traumatic events (5 min)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HaKYEnw4ec--oL_vPKCRK8ognGbzkc8BzfA6_aIpfo/edit ,"Comms, Internal:  Announcing traumatic events
Whether you let go of a single senior executive or lay off 30% of the company, it is a trauma to the organization. Anytime a ""negative"" occurrence like this happens, those that remain naturally ask themselves the question, ""Am I next?"" and they feel fear. This anxiety is not motivating but instead causes people to spend time and energy trying to figure out what is going on (talking to each other about this), creating other options (interviewing with other companies), etc. If the fear is allowed to fester, many will actually leave to get to a place of stability. All of this creates a tremendous downward pull on productivity. Therefore, your primary goal should be to minimize the feeling of fear in the organization.
And the best way to minimize fear is to ... acknowledge it! 
First, know that any trauma, whether small or large, takes time for the organization to heal from. 
Usually 2-3 months. And if a new trauma occurs before the organization has had time to heal from the last one fully, then organizational PTSD may well set in. 
Many CEOs ask: ""If I know that I will need to let go many people, is it better for me to drip out the terminations through rolling performance reviews, or should I terminate all at once?"" The answer from me is an unequivocal ""all at once."" Make it one trauma and begin the healing process, rather than a never-ending series of concussions from which the org cannot heal.
Second, know that when a traumatic event happens, a moment of trust or distrust happens. If you try to hide the fact that it occurred (make no announcement) or blame the people leaving, then the remainder of the org will lose trust in you. If, however, you announce the trauma to all, take responsibility for the fact that these people are leaving (i.e., ""I hired too many people too fast""), and put real time and effort into helping every terminated employee land a fantastic next job, then the org will gain significant trust in you.
Third, when the org does feel fear (as it will when you announce the RIF), the best way that I know to alleviate it is:
The first time a person learns that they are being let go, it is in a 1-1.  (Therefore schedule many 1-1s back to back with those being let go.  It is OK for each of these meetings to last only 10 minutes, and therefore to schedule them every 15 minutes.)  This is step 1.
In these 1-1s, share that you will schedule a longer follow-up where
They will sign their offboarding documents and receive their severance pay.
You will be their agent in finding their next job, if they are open to your help.  See Firing Well (updated) for the details.
Make sure that all of the remaining team members (the Stay Team) have the same information … a thorough announcement in an All Hands Meeting after the termination 1-1s have occurred.


Ensure that each person can vent their emotions … a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of learning about the trauma.  Cause each remaining team member to have a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of the All Hands Meeting.


During this 1-1, the manager should ask the team member to share their feelings and thoughts. The manager should not seek to defend or justify the company's actions but rather hear and acknowledge the team member's thoughts. 


If the team member is unwilling to share anything juicy, the manager can say, ""I imagine you are thinking …"" and then supply a juicy thought that the team member might plausibly be thinking (i.e., ""our CEO is a cold bastard""). Exaggerate the thought to the negative. If you do, it implicity permits the team member to express their less radical views. The team member will usually respond: ""Yeah, something like that, but not that strong."" or ""Not that, but what I am thinking is …."" 


Once the team member expresses their thought, the manager can show that they have heard by simply saying, ""I think I heard you say …"" and then summarizing what the team member said. Do this until the team member states, ""That's right."" Then the team member will feel heard, and this will dissipate much of their anger and fear. 
For further detail, read Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min)
Fourth, do not have the terminated employees remain at the company any longer than is absolutely necessary. If you are terminating them for cause, they will often be bitter and toxic during these post-termination days. If they were terminated because of a layoff, they will remind everyone of their sadness at their departure. Either way, it is healthier to start fresh with the new team as soon as possible. 
Fifth, word about the termination will likely spread. If it is newsworthy, a reporter will write about it and use it as proof that your company is failing. If you want to get ahead of this story, write it yourself and publish it before anyone else can write about it. Make it juicy enough that any other hit piece will be a darker shade of grey than what you wrote, and therefore not new enough to be worth writing. 
Lastly, the exact timing of making the announcement has several possible paths, each with its plus and minuses. I will discuss two here:
1. Managers announce the terminations in 1-1s before the AHM for the “stay team.”
Plus: 
The first time a terminated employee learns of the termination, they get 1-1 attention from their manager.
The first-time non-terminated employees attend an AHM; you assure them that they are part of the go-forward team.
Minus: 
The entire team does not have the same information at the same time.
2. An AHM happens first. You inform everyone of the ""why"" of the terminations. You invite those who are terminated to a 1-1 in the morning. A second AHM happens in the afternoon for the “stay team.”
Plus: 
The entire team has the same information at the same time.
Minus: 
If you announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., who has a 1-1 already scheduled in the morning), they will likely express their sadness and anger to their teammates while they await the 1-1.
If you do not announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., Managers come and get the next terminated person for a 1-1), then all will fear during the morning hours, not knowing if they will be next.
There is no correct answer between these paths. Just be aware of the Plus and Minus of each. 
Here, therefore, is my preferred timeline:
Preparation.  These steps to happen very close together: 
The executive team decides broad strokes of who they will terminate. 
Ask managers to give specific recommendations.
The executive team makes the final list. 
Managers set up 1-1s with all of their stay team members for Day 2. 
Schedule the terminations for the morning of Day 1. 
Schedule All Hands meetings for those who are staying for the afternoon of Day One.


These next steps are all to happen back-to-back in a total of 1-3 days: 
Day 0: Inform all managers who will be let go.
Day 1: 
All Hands Meeting 
State what you are doing
State why you are doing it
State that those with 1-1s in the morning are being let go, those in the afternoon are remaining.
Thank every person for their service, and assure them that you will spend real time making sure that they land softly … and then do it! 
Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling 
""You may well be thinking … 
Our CEO is a cold bastard.
This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary.""
If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.


Every manager meets 1-1 with every team member who is leaving. 
The manager commits to spending real-time helping them find their next role (and must follow through on this).
The manager listens to and acknowledges the team member's feelings and thoughts.
Create an alumni Slack channel. 
If you don't do it, they will. And you won't like the results if they create it on their own. 
Be in the channel and actively help alumni solve their problems.


All Hands Meeting with all of the remaining team to announce what is happening. 
State what you are doing
State why you are doing it
Express deep gratitude for all that has been done by both those that are leaving and those that remain.
Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling 
""You may well be thinking … 
Am I next?
Our CEO is a cold bastard.
This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary.""
If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.
State the go-forward Vision for the company. Who is the new customer, what is their problem, and how will you solve it.
 
Publish your article about the layoffs on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. 

Day 2, every manager meets 1-1 with all the remaining team members to vent their feelings and thoughts in the afternoon. 
The manager listens to and acknowledges the team member's feelings and thoughts using Heard:  how to make people feel it (2 min).
Reading this, if you are the CEO, you are likely feeling fear, especially if you have never done a layoff before. You may be thinking the following: 
""The press is going to write that we are failing."" 
""I can't bear to let all these people go who are really good and were so hard to recruit. It will take me so much effort to rehire their equal again later."" 
""Some of these people are single mothers with small children. I will be putting them out on the street.""
""They will hate me.""
All of these are legitimate thoughts. Their intent is positive … to keep you safe. But know that they are likely exaggerations. The reality is possible that:
If you write your press, the story will be over.
When you get leaner, the company will operate even more efficiently. And then when you do rehire, you will rehire even better people.
Those who are in dire economic circumstances, you will help to land a great position. And they may well be even better off then.
If you are transparent, take responsibility for the situation, and genuinely help each laid-off person find a new position, then you will likely be respected and appreciated.
Remember that Jack Welch is remembered as the greatest CEO of all time. And he was a one-trick pony. All he did was let go of the bottom 10% of GE each year and overcompensate the top 20%. That's it. Brutal, but highly effective.

Saying Goodbye to a Teammate (2 min) (Trishia Pasaquian),https://www.notion.so/mocharymethod/Saying-Goodbye-to-a-Teammate-c256b6c72f7c463f8ec586dd58c3b535 ,"# Saying Goodbye to a Teammate

<aside>
👋🏼 *Saying goodbye to a teammate is never easy. Whether it’s due to a teammate leaving for another job, retirement, or any other circumstance — saying farewell can be difficult and emotional.*

*It’s natural for those of us who have worked closely with someone over the years to feel a sense of loss when they are no longer part of our team.*

</aside>

### There are a few things to keep in mind when saying goodbye to a teammate:

### 👉🏼 **It is important to be respectful and to be understanding that this person is leaving - whether they’re leaving on their own accord or being let go.**

### 👉🏼 **If the person is being let go and you’ve already informed them of your decision (in 1:1), as a manager, give them some time to process the news and process their emotions.**

- Hearing this news can be devastating emotionally and financially for the person being let go. **It’s important to hold a safe space for the person to digest the news and first, process their fear or anger, or sadness, and then let them shift out of it.**
    - The time varies for everyone but it usually takes a day or two for them to really process.

### 👉🏼 **Bi-directionality is crucial when someone is leaving the team.**

- **Notify the team the same day that the person finds out - their end date, so it’s not a surprise to the team.** State the reason, to an extent that’s appropriate  - do not disclose private information.
    - The best thing is for the employment to end the same day as the person finds out they no longer have a job at MM. Having them stay after that point is not healthy for anyone. So, the person's last day is the day that they get the news. This should also be the day that the rest of the team gets the news as well.
- **Let the teammate announce the news themselves in the [#team-announcements](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C01AGLFTLKD) channel in Slack.**
    - Encourage them to give their farewells, leave their contact information, and tell the what they’re was up to next.

### 👉🏼 E**xpress gratitude for the time spent together.** There are a few ways to do this:

- **Block a time, say 10mins, in an all-hands meeting or the closest team meeting for everyone to celebrate the person** by:
    - Thank them for their contributions.
    - Acknowledge what they will be missed most of.
    - Offer well-wishes for their future endeavors.
- **Have a farewell lunch or happy hour.** If location and time permits, it can be valuable to hold an in-person gathering to eat out with the team to celebrate the person.
- If a sync meeting is not possible due to distributed time zones, you can opt to:
    1. **Write a farewell card or email where the team can share their love and appreciation for the person.** The manager can organize this and send it on their last day. That way, everyone starts humble and leaves grateful.
        - It could be in a message format or people can send a screenshot of what most represents the person leaving in their mind. Examples of this would be a slack message, a photo, a meme, work output, etc. These can be organized into a digital card/board.
    2. **This could also be in a video format.** People can individually record a loom/video celebrating the teammate and combine it as a company farewell with good wishes.
    3. **Send them off with a farewell gift (e.g. gift card, gift basket, etc.) as a token of appreciation for all they have done.**

### 👉🏼 Offer support if they need help transitioning into their new role or team.

- **Add the teammate to [#z-mm-alumni](https://mocharymethod.slack.com/archives/C04B8G1U9BM) (Mochary Method Alumni Channel) on Slack.** This is a quick and efficient way to stay in touch and check in with them from time to time.
- **Connecting on LinkedIn** will help you stay in touch after they leave so you can remain updated on each other's progressions throughout your careers—and even if there isn't an opportunity now, staying connected may lead to something great down the road!

### 👉🏼 Make sure that the team doesn't neglect themselves during these tough times.

- **Offer to do quick 1:1s with teammates individually** to hold space for them to talk about how they’re feeling about this person leaving, ask questions they might have, and make them feel heard and understood."
Navigating The Aftermath of Layoffs (By Sabrina Wang) (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/10TmIC8LWDVXjGtEYdhFxMavyYktR78P8Gaa8hcYeQzs/edit ,"Navigating The Aftermath of Layoffs (3 minutes)
By Sabrina Wang, CEO coach and Head of Coaching at Mochary Method
Watch at 2x: Sabrina going over the write-up in a Loom video
First, I want to acknowledge that layoffs are a difficult and challenging situation for any organization. This document will not be a complete set of answers. Rather, it’s a starting point to share some tried and tested tools from my CEO clients.
Layoffs can have a significant impact on the morale and motivation of employees who remain. As a CEO, your top concern may be maintaining the stability of your team and retaining your high performers. Here are a few steps you can take to help manage the situation and support your employees during this time of change.
Before you move on to the steps to navigate the aftermath, let’s review our Firing Well playbook and see if there are any tactics that you would like to implement before or during letting someone go. I interviewed Ophelia’s cofounder Mattan Griffel who shares his entire process and implementation around a layoff here.
Below, you can find the key recommendations for what happens after making a layoff decision.
Use an internal communication framework to announce the news
When it comes to announcing layoffs, it's crucial to have a clear and organized approach. Consider using Mochary Method’s guide to announce traumatic events. This will help you stay grounded and communicate the news effectively to your company. It is critical to have face-to-face 1-1 conversations with those who are let go and offer that face time to those who are staying to process their emotions.
One of our Mochary Method CEO coaches Faith Meyer wrote a write-up (You Lost Your Job. Now What?) that you can share directly or copy to send to your employees who are part of that layoff.
Conduct Magic Questions with your leadership team and managers
Magic Questions are a tool that can help you gauge the level of impact that layoffs are having on your employees. It’s key to ask questions and hold employees accountable for actions as you're going through Magic Questions. Check out instructions from Star performers:  How to keep them engaged and motivated.
Encourage your leadership team and managers to conduct Magic Questions with each of their direct reports, and consider conducting these surveys every 2-4 weeks for the next few months. This will create a space for employees to share their thoughts and feelings openly, helping to build trust and strengthen relationships.
Run an anonymous survey on motivation at work
If you want to get a deeper understanding of how layoffs are affecting employee motivation, consider conducting an anonymous survey. This can be especially effective if your company doesn't already have a culture of psychological safety, allowing employees to speak openly and honestly. If you do choose to run a survey, make sure to publicly share the top results and create a space for employees to ask questions and voice their concerns.
Ensure you’re personally supported 
Last but definitely not least, you and your executive team who are deeply involved in the layoff decision are going through an emotionally draining journey. These are hard decisions to make and trying conversations to have. It’s important that you are supported to process this news, so that you can be more available to your employees. I know of CEOs who commit to a more rigid personal routine during this time that includes but is not limited to cold plunges in the morning, daily fitness, meditation, therapy, coaching, time with family, and so on. If you need support during this time, please feel free to reach out to us at https://coach.mocharymethod.com/. We are here to help guide you to the right resources regardless of whether you become a coaching client or not.

Fear and Anger give bad advice (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit ,"Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)


Video of Matt talking about how fear and anger give bad advice (3 min)

Video of Justin Kan (Twitch, Atrium) talking about a time fear and anger gave him bad advice (5 min)
The essence of my coaching is to prove to you that when you feel fear or anger, your brain gives you bad advice. Whenever you notice that you are experiencing fear/anger, therefore, my recommendation is that you do one of the following: 
""Shift"" out of fear/anger before deciding what to do. And in the meantime, take no action. 

OR


If there is urgency and you must act immediately (which is almost never the case), do exactly the opposite of what your brain is recommending. 
If you are in Anger, and your brain is telling you to crush this person who has wronged you, instead get curious about why they did what they did. 


This action does not mean that you don't subsequently end your relationship with this person. It just means that you first genuinely seek to understand why they did what they did. There are lessons there for you because you likely had a hand in creating the situation.


If you are in Fear, and you want to not do an action for fear of the perceived consequences (i.e., give someone blunt feedback), instead do the action (provide them with feedback ... in a kind way). 


Once again, it doesn't mean that there is no risk to the decision. It's just likely that the benefit outweighs the risk. And that the unwanted outcome is likely not as dire as you imagine it to be.
Now, of course, you will be saying, ""Why? What proof do you have that my brain gives me bad advice when I am in anger or fear?"" The write-up below is my attempt to give you that evidence. But the best way is to try the suggestions above one time and see how things turn out. My prediction is that they will turn out well, and then you will not even need to read the rest of this write-up.
But in case you still want to read more ...
The pre-frontal cortex (located in the frontal lobe) is the part of our brain that is generally credited for problem-solving and creative thought. The amygdala (situated near the basal stem and often referred to as ""the reptile brain"") is that part of our brain which generates the emotion of fear or Anger (when presented with new, risky, or threatening stimuli).
In his book The Righteous Mind, John Haidt argues convincingly that human thought starts with an emotion. We react to external stimuli with an emotion (joy, sadness, fear, etc.). Then our powerful brain comes up with a story or perceived-fact pattern that explains our feelings. Once we create this story, confirmation bias causes us to see facts that further support our story, only hardening our belief in its ""truth.""
Emotions are valuable and intelligent signals for us. Fear signals that there is something new here or something potentially risky. It is helpful for us to be aware of that so that we don't proceed recklessly ahead. Similarly, anger signals that there is something that is potentially harming us or those around us. It is valuable for us to be aware of this so that we don't allow it to continue unabated. 
But that is where the intelligence of fear and anger ends. Our rational brain will create a story that justifies fear or anger. This story is usually a prediction that some horrible things will happen if we do an action (or don't do an action). The evolutionary value of fear is that it kept humans alive in a world where risk (the presence of a wild animal) or newness (an unknown berry) often led to death. By preventing humans from proceeding in those situations, fear kept humans alive. So whatever story the mind created to justify the fear contributed to keeping humans alive. A similar pattern existed for anger. 
That was then. In the modern world, the stories that fear creates do prevent us from acting. They do preserve our ego. But they also have a tremendous opportunity cost. By not acting, we never know if the board member that we do not have trust with would step down if we asked them, or whether the person in a critical role who is not performing well (but whom we think we cannot afford to have quit) would start performing if we gave them kind-hearted direct feedback.
When we encounter the unknown, fear predicts that something terrible will happen if we move forward. (Anger predicts that bad things will continue to happen unless we move forward.) But, by definition, we cannot be sure of what will happen in the future. There is a chance that something good will result from the action. If we think about that possibility for several minutes and allow ourselves to breathe deeply, fear often turns into excitement. 
And if we do move forward, we often discover that either our negative predictions don't materialize. Or, if they do, the result is still better than the current state. And when that happens, hopefully, we also have the thought: ""Fear (or anger) was giving me bad advice. I'm glad I didn't follow it.""
For a more thorough explanation of the above, please read Behave, or listen to the author's explanation in this video (1h13m).

If you are convinced that the above is true, you may be thinking: ""Yeah, but how do I catch myself? When I'm in fear or anger, I don't realize it at the moment. I act. It's only much later that I realize it.""
This awareness is a big challenge. You can spend years meditating, and it will provide marginal benefit in your ability to notice when you are in fear or anger. Or you can outsource this function to those around you. 
I far prefer the latter. I have asked everyone I live with (my wife and children) and work with to signal me when they perceive me to be in fear or anger. The words that seem to be the most effective with me are ""I perceive you to be in anger."" When I hear that, I can immediately stop. (By contrast, if they say ""You're in anger"" or ""Are you in anger?"", I feel more anger.)

If you are unconvinced that the writings above are accurate, there is a way to test them. Make a bet with someone. The next time someone perceives you to be in fear (this particular test works better with fear than anger), make a bet with them. Your brain will be making a prediction: ""If I do X, then Y will happen."" Their brain will be making a different prediction, Z, which is likely the opposite of Y. Then, do the action and see what happens. I posit that the other person will win the bet. 
I have made these bets hundreds of times with people that I perceive to be in fear. I have yet to lose. 

(This next idea comes from Regina Gerbeaux, COO at Mochary Method)
Fear Journaling

Or, if there is no one that you feel comfortable making a bet with, then make a bet with yourself.  To do this, create a Fear Journal.  Whenever you feel fear, or someone tells you that they perceive you to be in fear, write down what prediction your brain is making.  Do this regularly so that you are able to make many predictions.  Then, a week or a month or a year later, go back and read the predictions that you made.  See how many of them actually came true.  And if any came true, ask yourself if that outcome was actually negative. 
My posit is that very few, if any, of them will come true.  And those that do will actually turn out to be net positive.

Now you know the danger of acting on the thoughts generated by fear or anger.  Fear and Anger give bad advice (5 min)
Anger
Now you have a system for knowing when you are in Anger.
Hint: You ask those who are close to you (your colleagues, spouse, kids) to tell you when they perceive you to be in fear or Anger by saying, ""I perceive you to be in fear/anger.""
But how do you then shift out of Anger?
Time will often do the trick. But most of us can't afford a long time before needing our brains to function well, especially when we don't know how long it will take.
There are ways to speed the process up. Here is a very non-exhaustive list of ideas to shift out of Anger. None of these are magic pills. Each is something to experiment with. Find what works for you.
The key is to activate other parts of your brain besides your amygdala. You can do this by getting your brain to focus on something different than the singular perspective you have on this issue. Try ...
A new physical location
If you're sitting down, stand up.
If you're inside, go outside.
A new physical state
If you're still, go outside and start sprinting as fast as you can for 2 minutes.
A new mental state
If you are bombarded by continuous stimulation (as almost all of us are with constant messaging, alerts, screen time, meetings, calls, etc.), then go stimulation-free (turn off all messaging, alerts, screens, etc.). Get bored. Restoration and Creativity: how to achieve them (3 min)
A new perspective on the issue
Do The Work by Byron Katie
Give your feelings and thoughts full expression:
If you feel Anger, go into another room (or a car), grab a pillow and yell as loud as you can into that pillow for 30 seconds. 
Hopefully, the distance and the pillow will muffle the sound enough that no one else will hear you. Practice this first to make sure it's the case.
Keep a journal, and write your worst thoughts full of all the swear words in your head.
There are many other ways. These are just some things with which you can experiment. You only need one that works for you.  
Fear

Fear is less physical than anger, and therefore the shift moves are less physical and more mental.  The Work by Byron Katie works well here.  But for me, the most effective is to make actual predictions.  “If I do this, then x will happen.  And then what?  And then y will happen.  And then what?  And then z will happen ….”  I do this all the way to the end.  

I then either:


Write it down in a Fear Journal (see under “Fear Journaling”: Fear and Anger give bad advice)


I revisit later to see if the predictions came true or not.  They almost never do, certainly not in the net-negative way that I predicted.  Or …


Share my predictions with an accountability partner and ask them what predictions they make.  If we make differing predictions, we make a bet.  


If I am the person feeling fear, I almost always lose the bet.  Of course to see the results of the bet, I need to do the thing that I fear doing.  That requires a push.  But each time I go through this cycle, I need less and less of a push.

Once I lose such a bet or prediction, my mind starts to unwind its belief in the quality of advice that fear gives me.   This is a never-ending process, however, since fear will continue to try to re-assert itself.

Emotions - name them (1 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qViPEjTQ7XlkvZAqU1YZQYJtpPqgjvyxPaKXpwbb_L4/edit ,"Emotions - name them (1 min)

We all experience emotions. There is nothing wrong with them. In fact, they are healthy and contain their intelligence. 
I posit that there are five basic emotions -- excitement, joy, fear, anger, and sadness -- and that all other emotions are simply a shade of these basic ones, just as all colors are some combination of red, yellow, and blue.
Excitement is future-looking. We don't know what will occur, but we predict that it will be good.
Fear is future-looking. We don't know what will happen, and we predict that it will not be good.
Joy is present. What is happening right now is good.
Anger is present. What is happening right now is not good.
Sadness is the past. What has already happened in the past is not good and is likely unrecoverable. This emotion can be a death of a person or a vision of what could have been. 
So, emotions are an alert for us to notice. That is healthy. But when we experience fear or anger, our brain function moves from our pre-frontal cortex (creative thought) to our amygdala (fight or flight response), which is only capable of minimal thought.

Fear vs Joy (3 min),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZqiTrDF6bcQYa3UFEKTqkuyyTHJCI_rpd173VubJ64/edit ,"Fear vs Joy (3 min)
Fear is an excellent motivator. It fueled humanity in times of scarcity. And continues to do so now in times of abundance. 
Many of us fear failure, but even more of us fear being viewed as a failure. This fear of failure drives us to work maniacally to achieve. 
But as good a motivator as fear is, there is a better one: Joy. For proof of this, find someone who has achieved joy in their work-life (admittedly, they are rare) and ask them whether they are more motivated and more successful when fueled by fear. I'm sure you can guess their answer: Far more motivated, far more successful, and most importantly … feeling peaceful and satisfied all day every day. 
This path, of course, sounds like something reserved for only those who already have made it financially. And there certainly is a high correlation to those who achieve this state with prior financial success, but that is not causation. It is merely a forcing function. 
Most people dream of financial success. They tell themselves: ""When I achieve wealth, all will be well. I will be happy; life will be good."" Then they achieve financial success, but no happiness, peace, or satisfaction arrives. It exposes this dream as a false one. Now, these people have no choice but to go in search of peace elsewhere. Some of them eventually find their ""purpose"" and experience true and lasting joy, satisfaction, and peace for the first time in their lives.
When hearing this, people say: ""But if I lose fear, won't I simply decide that making money is pointless and then go sit on a beach for the rest of my life?"" The answer is: ""If you're not careful about how you transition from fear to joy, then yes.""
I view Fear and Joy as motivation mountains. If you lose Fear before you discover Joy in your work, then you will indeed fall into a motivation valley and may not have any motivation to continue at work. It is then quite possible to get stuck there and not be able to climb out.
The key, therefore, is to discover Joy in your work first. The best way that I know to do this is the Energy Audit. Once you are experiencing Joy at work daily, it is safe to move on to losing Fear. And the best ways to lose Fear that I know of are Consciousness Training options.  (The link is currently only available to those whom I coach due to sensitive information.)
What welcomes you on the other side of this effort is daily Joy (even bliss) at work and in all of your life, as well as a massive success, because you will continue in your work for decades and decades, which in the end will bring far more success and a short fear-fueled sprint.
Enjoy!

Btw, if you currently find yourself in a motivation valley, all is not lost. There is a way out. It is the Energy Audit. But you may not have much that gives you energy. That's OK. Do the exercise regularly, and you will begin to discover things that provide you with energy. At first, a little bit of energy, and then later massive amounts of it.

Drama Triangle (and 100% Responsibility),https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0_uQLGnf8gt3bQEOQhGH-bJhY_Zb62eyEl1YdfVS1s/edit ,"Drama Triangle (and 100% Responsibility)

Whenever we see a problem, we often feel some degree of anger and fear. This causes our brain to go into some level of ""fight or flight"" mode, which causes us to be more interested in convincing others that our solution is right, rather than getting curious about what we can learn (from others and the situation). If you believe, as I do, that better solutions come from shifting to a place of curiosity rather than wanting to be correct, the critical question then becomes: ""How do I shift?""
There are many ways to do so. Below is one. 
This method asks each of us to:
First, state in starkest terms our thoughts come from wanting to be right (""below the line""). If we can express them verbally, then we can often let go of our attachment to them. This step is sometimes the only action needed to move to a productive conversation and easeful solution.
Second, rather than look at the problem as externally-created (and therefore only externally-solvable), we state what we did to create the situation (""above the line""). This statement often highlights what we can do to solve it. Again, this second step may be enough to move to an easeful solution.
Third, if we want to understand why we feel Fear or Anger in these situations (and then cut those feelings off at the source), we can think back deeply into our childhood to see when this pattern first appeared, as it likely appeared as a very normal response of a young child to an external stimulus. If we can see that, then we can see how that ""persona"" was helpful to us as a child but is no longer beneficial to us as adults now.
Fourth, if we have shifted to a place of curiosity, we then state if we are willing to discover a resolution quickly. If the answer is yes, then we proceed.
Fifth, discuss amongst the group, discover a solution and make agreements.
Identify issue:
Below the Line:
Steps:
""I blame (a person's name) for (an action)."" Villain
""This negatively affects me in the following way …."" Victim
""I temporarily solve this situation by …."" Hero
Once you complete one round, go back to Step 1 and pick a different person. If Steps 2 and 3 are identical, there is no need to repeat them.
Continue going through the Steps until there is no one else to blame. Remember, you can always blame yourself.

Above the Line:
I created this situation by…
Questions to answer to help you take 100% responsibility:
What do you have to be right about?
What do you withhold, and from whom?
What do you not face?
What feelings do you repress/conceal?
What do you have to believe about yourself, others, and the world?
How do you numb yourself from the discomfort?
What ""shoulds"" do you have to believe?
What behaviors do you do or not do to keep the issue in place?
To what do you feel entitled?
What are you trying to control that is NOT in your control?
What do you believe you do not have enough of?
What either/or story do you have to hold about this issue?
Who do you have to be better/less than?
What agreements do you have to make and/or break with yourself or others?
What do you have to be afraid of?
The long-standing pattern this reminds me of is…
Am I willing to now easefully and playfully discover a solution?

Drama Triangle,https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Zg0OfkR5-EXyiL8Zd8sfiCWl1D3h89eO_OPgF7Fdqc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337 ,"The Drama Triangle
When we discuss challenges or issues as a group, we often suffer from two bad habits:
1. We believe that we know the correct answer and try to convince others to see our point of view.
2. We never truly share our deepest, darkest thoughts and feelings for fear of offending others.
This pattern often leads us down a negative pathway and causes the following problems:
1. We cannot fully see other perspectives, so we don't get complete information.
2. Others never fully appreciate our perspective because we haven't fully shared it.
To elicit your team's full potential, though, you must create an environment where ideas can flow freely. The following exercise, called The Drama Triangle, will encourage your team members to share fully by allowing them the safety of distancing themselves from their perspectives. To apply it to a situation or conflict, have each person stand up one at a time and declare a Hero, Victim, and Villain by answering the following questions:
- Hero: 
""I temporarily solve the situation by ______.""
- Victim: 
""I am negatively affected by this in the following ways:______.""
""I am powerless to permanently solve this situation because:______.""
- Villain: 
""I blame (name of a real person) for creating this situation by doing (real action).""
Each person continues this cycle, blaming a new person each time until no one is left to blame for that issue. (Remember, you can also blame yourself!) 
Then everybody answers this question: ""Are you willing to easefully and playfully resolve this issue in this meeting?""
The group then moves to brainstorm solutions. 
In my experience, it is easy to come up with elegant and complete solutions once all of the ""worst"" information is on the table and nothing remains hidden. 
I highly recommend using a knowledgeable outsider to facilitate this meeting, at least for the first time. They will keep your team on a script. If anyone goes off-script and gets angry, the results can be very messy.

Uses a system called Core Transformation (1h06m, only watch 1-2 minutes to get a sense of the process)  Akin to consciousness, but is able to infuse it into the body making it far easier to “not get triggered”.  Highly recommended by Matt.

GS Youngblood (gs@gsyoungblood.com)
Wrote an excellent book called The Masculine in Relationship, which translates David Deida’s work into very easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply behaviors.  He also does very effective 1-1 coaching at a reasonable rate.  Highly recommended by Matt.

Patty Wipfler.   She has made a huge difference in my life (and our kids’).   Her book “Listen” is good, her approach very consistent with Dan Siegel’s science (he is probably the best known  child development psychologist) and she also does personal coaching of both parents and children to deal with specific challenges.  I have recommended her to quite a number of people and have always heard good things.   patty@handinhandparenting.org.   Feel free to mention my name (Bo Shao).

Bez Stone
Training to reignite sexual desire in a woman (primarily for couples in long-term relationships who are no longer having sex).  Loosely related to red Tantra.

David Deida
Teaching the man to fully be in the masculine persona and thus give his partner a spiritual sexual experience.  Loosely related to red Tantra.

"Conscious Leadership (2 min to read, 15 min for the videos)",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0k55kyb1AqewHIsQPmvAMchpprTtfxA0NzaIHmLeEQ/edit# ,"Conscious Leadership (2 min to read, 15 min for the videos)

Conscious Leadership is about being more interested in learning than being right. When our egos make us afraid to be wrong, that fear leads us to defend our ideas at all costs and work hard to convince others that we are right—often with anger. Conscious Leadership is about:
Recognizing when these emotions (fear, anger, sadness) have gripped our thought processes.
Releasing these emotions and shifting back to a state of curiosity where we are receptive to all ideas and creativity, even if they seem to contradict our own. It is in a state of playful curiosity that we achieve exquisite solutions.
Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman, and Kaley Warner Klemp explain this concept thoroughly in their book The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership.
The challenge, of course, is to shift from wanting to be right to wanting to learn. Here are some videos that help with that shift.

The Drama Triangle
100% Responsibility
Revealing or Concealing
Empathy
Spiritual teacher and author David Deida goes one step further and teaches that empathy is the key to success. To truly feel the feelings of those around you—customers, investors, and team members alike—you must get very curious about their situations and then really imagine yourself in their shoes. If you do this, people will sense it and immediately trust and like you because they will feel that you care about them and understand their circumstances. They'll trust you to lead them because they know you'll truly consider their interests in your guidance.
Joy vs. Fear
When people start diving into the Conscious Leadership work, they quickly lose their fear. And just as quickly, they realize that fear was their primary motivator—fear of failure, fear of letting people down. Once fear is gone, their life becomes much better, but their business suffers. 
If you find yourself in this situation, keep pushing forward with the Conscious Leadership work quickly to get to a place where you are motivated by joy. Joy is an even better motivator than fear, so your business will thrive. And your life will be amazing! Then you will have the best of all worlds.
Summary
Many CEOs that I coach have deeply embraced the principles of Conscious Leadership. Alex MacCaw, founder and CEO of Clearbit, is one of them. He has written this excellent summary of the Conscious Leadership principles, found in Appendix A.
